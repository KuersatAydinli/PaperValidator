contractions and impair perineal support by causing the delivery to progress too quickly, and thereby increase the risk of perineal injury. thus, the widespread use of oxy- tocin in daily obstetric practice calls for an exploration of its possible harmful effects. the aim of our study was to assess the association between oxytocin augmentation and obstetric anal sphincter injuries in a dynamic model related to the active second stage of labour. materials and methods the department of obstetrics and gynecology of stavanger university hospital serves as the only delivery unit for a population of 320 000 people, and approxi- mately 4500 deliveries occur there annually. from 1996 onward, all obstetric data have been consecutively recorded. the electronic database consists of clearly deﬁned variables, and is continuously maintained using standardised procedures for data entry and quality control. during the study period, 15 may 1999 to 15 may 2012, 56 517 women with a pregnancy duration of ≥23 weeks of gestation delivered infants with a bw of >300 g in the department. estimated day of delivery was determined by second trimester ultrasound scan or from menstrual data when no ultrasound examination was performed. we restricted the study population to nulliparous women whose labour started spontaneously, with single cephalic presentation, pregnancies of ≥37 weeks of gestation (group 1 in robson’s ten group classiﬁcation system; tgcs19) and who delivered vagi- nally. after excluding 69 women with missing data (52 without an estimated day of delivery, 17 with missing information of fetal presentation at delivery), this case– control study comprised 15 476 women. the main outcome measure was obstetric anal sphinc- ter injuries as deﬁned by the international continence society, that is, partial or complete tears of the anal sphincter muscles, with or without disruption of the anal mucosa (grades 3–4 perineal tears).20 when an obstetric anal sphincter injury was suspected, the obstet- rician on call diagnosed the grade of the tear during surgical repair. oxytocin augmentation was deﬁned as oxytocin used to stimulate contractions during established labour. an intravenous infusion of 5 international units (0.01 mg) of oxytocin in 500 ml saline was administered, starting with 30 ml/h and a dose increment of 15 ml/h every 15 min to a maximum of 180 ml/h, guided by the response. normal births were taken care of by midwives, while doctors performed the operative deliveries. throughout the study period, episiotomy was performed either mediolaterally or laterally. according to our rou- tines and national guidelines, operative vaginal delivery was indicated if delivery had not taken place after 60 min of bearing down. we used vacuum extraction with a malmström metal cup as the preferred procedure for operative vaginal delivery. vacuum extraction was applied for mid-cavity and outlet release. a combination of low-dose ropivicaine/fentanyl was used for epidural analgaesia. ethnicity was classiﬁed as western, that is, originating from europe or north america, or non-western. the intention of this study was to explore the effect of three obstetric practices (oxytocin augmentation (o), episiotomy (e) and vacuum/forceps (vf)) and bw on obstetric anal sphincter injuries before other risk factors were considered. these main risk factors correlate as episiotomy is often used for instrumental deliveries and when large babies are expected. furthermore, oxytocin augmentation is provided for failure to progress because of dystocia. women with dystocia are more often deliv- ered instrumentally than women without dystocia. this basic understanding of the birth dynamics of the ﬁrst and second stages of labour indicates that the main risk factors may have a direct or indirect effect on obstetric anal sphincter injuries, and that the effects of categories across different explanatory variables are not constant on the outcome. we analysed our dataset using the χ2 test and back- ward manual stepwise logistic regression analyses with p<0.05 as signiﬁcance level. we built and checked the ﬁt of our regression model as proposed by agresti.21 step one compares the model including the highest order four-way interaction with a model without the four-way interaction. if the highest order product is not signiﬁ- cant, agresti proposes continuing by removing the highest order term with the highest non-signiﬁcant p value until all remaining terms have statistically signiﬁ- cant p values. four main predictors (o, e, vf and bw) are used to predict the proportions of women with sphincter injuries. confounders, possible risk factors in addition to the main factors of interest, were tested one by one and set to at least 10% change in any estimate in the model of best ﬁt. interaction terms were signiﬁcant at p<0.05. statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics for windows, v.19.0, ibm corp, armonk, new york, usa. the regional committee for medical and health research ethics, western norway, approved the protocol as a quality assurance study in obstetric care, and fulﬁll- ing the requirements for data protection procedures (rek 2011-1247). results the study population comprised 15 476 (27%) of the 56 517 women giving birth during the study period, including 1013 (53%) of a total of 1894 women diag- nosed with obstetric anal sphincter injuries. the overall prevalence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries was 6.5%. the rate declined from 9.6% in 1999– 2000 to 2.8% in 2010–2012. the characteristics of the study population and the prevalence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries are displayed in table 1. the prevalence was higher in women who received oxyto- cin augmentation (8.0% vs 5.3%), those who were delivered 2 rygh ab, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004592. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004592 open access


instrumentally (11.0% vs 5.2%) and in those who gave birth to an infant weighing ≥4000 g (12.9% vs 5.6%). furthermore, the prevalence increased with longer dura- tions of the active part of the second stage of labour. after adopting the strategy of agresti by deleting the highest statistically non-signiﬁcant terms in the model until all remaining terms are statistically signiﬁcant, we ended up with a best ﬁtting model involving the three- way interaction of oxytocin augmentation, episiotomy and vacuum/forceps (o×e×vf) and the two two-way interactions episiotomy/birth weight (e×bw) and vacuum/forceps (vf×bw) (model a). we could resolve interaction terms into stratiﬁed analysis of eight strata of combinations of oxytocin augmentation, episiotomy and instrumental delivery for bw <4000 g, and four strata of combinations of episiotomy, instrumental delivery and bw ≥4000 g, independent of oxytocin augmentation. the results are displayed in table 2. table 1 characteristics of the study population and the prevalence of obstetric anal sphincter injury obstetric anal sphincter injury in total n=15 476 prevalence per cent p valuefactor no yes n=14 463 n=1013 per cent per cent time period <0.001 1999–2000 11.1 16.9 1781 9.6 2001–2003 19.8 30.7 3169 9.8 2004–2006 22.9 29.6 3611 8.3 2007–2009 25.5 14.3 3826 3.8 2010–2012 20.8 8.6 3089 2.8 maternal factors age (years) <0.001 <25 26.6 19.3 4040 4.9 25–29 33.5 37.6 5233 7.3 30–34 17.8 20.8 2785 7.6 ≥35 22.1 22.2 3418 6.6 origin ns* western 90.5 92.0 14 025 6.6 non-western 9.5 8.0 1451 5.6 obstetric factors epidural analgaesia ns no 58.1 57.7 8992 6.5 yes 41.9 42.3 6484 6.6 oxytocin augmentation <0.001 no 55.6 44.7 8500 5.3 yes 44.4 55.3 6976 8.0 active 2nd stage of labour (min) <0.001 missing information 0.6 0.3 92 3.3 0–14 10.8 6.8 1627 4.2 15–29 26.8 18.5 4063 4.6 30–59 40.1 37.8 6181 6.2 ≥60 21.7 36.6 3513 10.6 episiotomy ns no 67.1 65.4 10 372 6.4 yes 32.9 34.6 5104 6.9 operative vaginal delivery <0.001 no 77.5 60.3 11 817 5.2 yes 22.5 39.7 3659 11.0 fetal factors birth weight (g) <0.001 <4000 87.8 74.2 13 454 5.6 ≥4000 12.2 25.8 2022 12.9 occiput posterior position ns no 95.4 94.8 14 771 6.5 yes 4.5 5.2 705 7.4 p values from χ2 tests. *non-significant. rygh ab, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004592. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004592 3 open access


from a clinical perspective we can simplify model a into model b by collapsing groups that comprise similar risks for sphincter injury by obstetric interventions despite overlapping cis. spontaneous delivery of an infant weighing <4000 g without oxytocin augmentation and episiotomy was chosen as the reference group (group 1). we collapsed groups 1 and 2 as the or for sphincter injury was similar with and without episiotomy in unstimulated, spontaneous births of normal-size infants. groups 3 to 6 displayed the or for sphincter injury in instrumental deliveries of normal-size infants with and without oxytocin augmentation and episiotomy. a marked difference in the or for sphincter injury was observed between women delivered instrumentally with (groups 3 and 5) and without (groups 4 and 6) episiot- omy, despite the fact that those stimulated with oxytocin had a non-signiﬁcant lower or for sphincter injury. it was, therefore, reasonable to collapse groups 3 and 5 and groups 4 and 6. furthermore, we collapsed groups 7 and 8 as the or for sphincter injury was similar with and without episiotomy during spontaneous deliveries of infants <4000 g, regardless of oxytocin augmentation. finally, the use of episiotomy appeared to be strongly associated with lower or for sphincter injury in instru- mental deliveries of infants ≥4000 g (groups 11 and 12). the modiﬁed model b (table 3) comprises a clinically relevant risk estimation of anal sphincter injury among the main modiﬁed risk factors for sphincter injury. age, origin of the mother and occiput posterior pos- ition had no confounding effect on ors for obstetric anal sphincter injury across combinations of episiotomy, oxytocin augmentation, operative vaginal delivery and bw (groups a to g in table 3). the unadjusted or for the presence or absence of epidural analgaesia was 1.02; however, the adjusted or for epidural analgaesia was 0.73, (95% ci 0.63 to 0.84), that is, epidural analgaesia was associated with a 30% lower or of anal sphincter injury. table 2 model a: stratified analyses of eight strata of combinations of oxytocin augmentation, episiotomy, instrumental delivery and birth weights <4000 g, and four strata of episiotomy, instrumental delivery and birth weights ≥4000 g, independent of oxytocin augmentation group oxytocin augmentation* episiotomy* operative vaginal delivery* birth weight† women n oasi‡ n (%) or 95% ci 1 − − − − 5328 198 (3.7) 1.0 2 − + − − 1434 60 (4.2) 1.1 0.8 to 1.5 3 − + + − 537 43 (8.0) 2.3 1.6 to 3.2 4 − − + − 316 47 (14.9) 4.5 3.2 to 6.4 5 + + + − 1283 92 (7.2) 2.0 1.6 to 2.6 6 + − + − 896 103 (11.5) 3.4 2.6 to 4.3 7 + − − − 2621 148 (5.6) 1.6 1.3 to 1.9 8 + + − − 1039 61 (5.9) 1.6 1.2 to 2.2 9 +/– + − + 418 40 (9.6) 2.7 1.9 to 3.9 10 +/− − − + 977 104 (10.6) 3.1 2.4 to 4.0 11 +/− + + + 393 55 (14.0) 4.2 3.1 to 5.8 12 +/− − + + 234 62 (26.5) 9.3 6.8 to 12.9 crude or and 95% cis. *used (+)/unused (−). †≥4000 g (+)/<4000 g (−). ‡obstetric anal sphincter injury. table 3 modified model displaying the collapsed non-significant strata (1–12) from table 2 into new strata (a–g) group (group in table 2) oxytocin augmentation* episiotomy* operative vaginal delivery* birth weight† women n oasi‡ n (%) or aor (95% ci) a (1,2) − +/− − − 6762 258 (3.8) 1.0 1.0 b (7,8) + +/− − − 3660 209 (5.7) 1.5 1.8 (1.5 to 2.2) c (3,5) +/− + + − 1820 135 (7.4) 2.0 2.3 (1.8 to 2.8) d (4,6) +/− − + − 1212 150 (12.4) 3.6 4.1 (3.3 to 5.1) e (9–10) +/− +/− − + 1395 144 (10.3) 2.9 3.1 (2.5 to 3.9) f (11) +/− + + + 393 55 (14.0) 4.1 4.7 (3.4 to 6.5) g (12) +/− − + + 234 62 (26.5) 9.1 10.5 (7.6 to 14.4) unadjusted or, adjusted (aor) and 95% cis after adjusting for epidural analgaesia. *used (+)/unused (−). †≥4000 g (+)/<4000 g (−). ‡obstetric anal sphincter injury. 4 rygh ab, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004592. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004592 open access


the use of oxytocin augmentation increased with the duration of the second stage of labour over all the time periods from an average of 32% in the <30 min group, 46% in the 30–59 min group, and 65% (range 49–76%) in the ≥60 min group during the active second stage of labour. the prevalence of operative deliveries across all study periods was consistently between 45% and 49% when the active part of the second stage of labour lasted ≥60 min versus 12–21% for durations of the second stage of labour of <60 min. we found strong associations between oxytocin augmentation and the duration of the second stage, and between operative delivery and the duration of the second stage (collinearity), which means that the duration of the second stage is measured through operative delivery and oxytocin augmentation. discussion we found that oxytocin augmentation during active labour was associated with a 80% increased or of obstetric anal sphincter injury in women in tgcs group 1 giving spontaneous birth to an infant weighing <4000 g. we did not ﬁnd an association between episiot- omy and tears during spontaneous deliveries, but a sig- niﬁcantly reduced association in all operative vaginal deliveries. oxytocin augmentation is widely used in delayed labour to prevent operative delivery. however, a cochrane review concluded that a reduction of labour by 2 h was the only proven effect, and there was no effect on operative deliveries.18 another recent review found the entire concept of active management of labour to be associated with a slightly reduced risk of caesarean delivery.22 as in other studies, we found that approximately 50% of nulliparous women received oxy- tocin augmentation.16 17 23 there is reason to believe that guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pro- tracted labour are unclear or inconsistently applied in daily practice.17 we hypothesise that stimulation with oxytocin may speed up the progress of the expulsive phase of labour leading to rushed situations, impaired communication with the mother, less focus on protec- tion of the perineum and a controlled delivery of the head. recent studies from norway indicate that focus on these elements is important in preventing perineal injuries.24 25 many authors have used logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries, but only a few have included oxytocin augmentation. samuelsson et al,14 prager et al,15 and jander and lyrenas5 found oxytocin augmentation to be predictive of obstetric anal sphincter injuries in univariate analysis, but only jander and lyrenas conﬁrmed this ﬁnding in multivariable analyses. samuelsson et al14 did not stratify by parity, which is a methodological weakness since the true effect of other factors is concealed by the strong impact of parity. prager et al15 studied obstetric anal sphincter injuries in nulliparous women, entering oxytocin augmentation, duration of active second stage of labour and instrumental delivery into the same model. our study shows strong collinearity between a pro- longed active second stage of labour and both oxytocin augmentation and instrumental delivery. we consider the duration of the active second stage of labour to be a ‘proxy’ for oxytocin augmentation and instrumental delivery, and not a risk factor for obstetric anal sphincter injury in itself. long duration of the second stage is a time-related event before the expulsion of the head. during this latency the active forces do not inﬂict injury on the sphincter apparatus, the sphincter injury occurs during the expulsive phase. consequently, we do not consider the duration of the active second stage as a risk factor for anal sphincter injuries. jander and lyrenas5 conducted a single institution, retrospective, case–control study of 214 cases to explore 44 possible risk factors, and found that oxytocin aug- mentation was a signiﬁcant risk factor for obstetric anal sphincter injuries in multivariable analyses (or 2.00; 95% ci 1.13 to 3.53). however, these researchers did not stratify by parity or state whether or not interactions were tested for. furthermore, three older studies on the risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury included oxytocin use without differentiating whether oxytocin was pro- vided for induction or augmentation purposes.26–28 three large population-based studies on the risk of obstetric anal sphincter injuries did not include oxytocin augmentation in their analyses.1 7 8 the inﬂuence of epidural analgaesia on anal sphinc- ter injuries is unclear. eskandar and shet9 found a reduced risk, but did not stratify by parity. dahl and kjølhede10 found epidural analgaesia to be an inde- pendent protective factor in nulliparous women. poen et al29 stratiﬁed by parity and found a signiﬁcantly increased or associated with epidural analgaesia in nul- liparous women. in our study, epidural analgaesia was associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced or for sphincter tears. our study takes into account four factors that exert their effect on the anal sphincter during the ﬁnal minutes of delivery. as in previous studies,1 3 5 we found both operative vaginal delivery and high bw to be strongly associated with obstetric anal sphincter injuries. we found episiotomy to be associated with a lower preva- lence of sphincter tears in operative vaginal deliveries, but not in spontaneous births. this is consistent with a large national registry study from norway,1 but differs from other studies.8 11 13 30 31 in our study, neither oxy- tocin augmentation nor episiotomy were associated with obstetric anal sphincter injury during spontaneous deliv- ery of an infant weighing ≥4000 g. our methodological approach, stratifying by the factors that are active during the expulsive phase of labour and testing for confounders, is considered the strength of the study. this approach leads to a more detailed understanding of how oxytocin augmentation rygh ab, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004592. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004592 5 open access


interacts with these major risk factors. logistic regression analyses, without testing for possible interactions, would fail to reveal this information. this case–control study is based on prospectively collected data from a large unse- lected population, and represents all deliveries meeting the inclusion criteria that occurred during the study period, which make bias unlikely. our department has a high proportion of vaginal deliveries. the overall caesar- ean delivery rate in our institution was 12.5% over the study period. for women in tgcs group 1 the acute caesarean section rate increased from 5.0% in 1999 to 7.5% in 2012. accordingly, the study population includes both high-risk and low-risk pregnancies, which adds to the external validity of our results. however, some limitations apply. we cannot prove caus- ality between oxytocin augmentation and obstetric anal sphincter injuries in an observational study. furthermore, socioeconomic status, smoking, body mass index, mater- nal delivery positions, perineal support technique and the birth attendant’s experience level may be possible risk modiﬁers not included in our database. finally, single institution studies, also when based on unselected populations, should be interpreted with caution. our ﬁndings have some important implications. birth attendants should be aware of the association between oxytocin augmentation and obstetric anal sphincter injuries in the large subgroup of nulliparous women giving spontaneous birth to a normal-size infant. more restrictive use of oxytocin may help prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries. implementation of evidence- based guidelines for using oxytocin augmentation should be encouraged. the who recommends the use of a partogram with an action line deﬁning failure to progress. however, a recent cochrane review could not conﬁrm that such a partogram was beneﬁcial in high resource settings.32 given the doubtful beneﬁts from augmentation of labour, randomised controlled trials are strongly needed, and we propose anal sphincter injury as one of the most important endpoints. moreover, our study supports restricted use of episiot- omy during normal births and as a recommendation for operative vaginal deliveries. bw is an important, albeit unpredictable risk factor as weight estimation of a large fetus is unreliable.33 author affiliations 1department of obstetrics and gynecology, stavanger university hospital, stavanger, norway 2department of clinical medicine i, university of bergen, bergen, norway 3women’s health and perinatology research group, department of clinical medicine, uit the arctic university of norway, tromsø, norway 4department of gi surgery, stavanger university hospital, stavanger, norway 5national center for fetal medicine, trondheim university hospital (st olavs hospital), trondheim, norway acknowledgements the authors highly appreciate the work carried out by leif k gjessing, md, in establishing the obstetric databases of stavanger university hospital. contributors abr, fes, hk and tme have contributed to the idea and design of the research project. abr and tme managed the data set and the statistical analyses were performed by fes. all authors have contributed to the interpretation of the results and the writing of the manuscript. funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. competing interests none. ethics approval the regional committee for medical and health research ethics, western norway. provenance and peer review not commissioned;
