2    abstract:   background:  an ancillary finding in previous research suggested that the use of antidepressant  medications increased the risk of developing clostridium difficile infection (cdi).  our objective  was to evaluate whether depression or the use of antidepressants altered the risk of developing  cdi using two distinct datasets and study designs.  methods:   in study 1, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of a nationally-representative  sample of older americans (n=16,781), linking data from biennial interviews to physician visits,  hospital stays, emergency department visits, skilled nursing facility stays, home health visits and  other outpatient visits.  in study 2, we completed a clinical study of hospitalized adults who were  tested for c. difficile (n=4047), with cases testing positive and controls testing negative.   antidepressant medication use prior to testing was extracted.   results:   the population-based rate of cdi in older americans was 282.9/100,000 person-years  (95% ci: 226.3, 339.5) for individuals with depression and 197.1/100,000 person-years for those  without depression (95% ci: 168.0, 226.1).  the odds of cdi were 36% greater in persons with  major depression (95% ci: 1.06, 1.74), 35% greater in individuals with depressive disorders  (95% ci: 1.05, 1.73), 54% greater in those who were widowed (95% ci: 1.21, 1.95), and 25%  less in adults who did not live alone (95% ci: 0.62, 0.92).  self-report of feeling sad or having  emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems at baseline were also associated with the later  development of cdi.  use of certain antidepressant medications during hospitalization was  associated with altered risk of cdi.               conclusions:   adults with depression and who take specific antidepressants appear to be more  likely to develop cdi.  older adults who are widowed or who live alone are also at greater risk  of cdi.   


3    background   clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is the most commonly diagnosed cause of antibiotic- associated diarrhea and has emerged as a major nosocomial infection, surpassing methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus in some hospitals.1  in addition to causing more than 7,000  deaths annually in the united states,2 it is prevalent in hospitals throughout europe with a mean  frequency of 23 cases for every 10,000 admissions.3 concerted efforts to identify modifiable risk  factors for cdi are motivated by the significant need for better preventive and therapeutic  options against this infection.     modifiable risk factors of cdi include several classes of medications such as proton pump  inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists.4  antidepressants have also been implicated.5  in  a cohort study of 14,719 hospitalized patients, an ancillary finding of an association between  antidepressant medications and cdi was reported, which was stronger than that found for proton  pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists.5  a possible link between antidepressant  medications and cdi is noteworthy since, worldwide, depression is the third most prevalent  disabling condition, as reported by the world health organization.6  effects of depression have  been shown to include alterations in the gut microbiota and increased intestinal permeability.7-9   in the murine model, behavioral depression increases jejunal permeability and susceptibility to  colitis.10  in population-based human studies, depression was found to be significantly predictive  of inflammatory bowel disease.11,12      since the publication of the dalton et al. study linking antidepressant use with the risk of cdi,5  there has been no evidence, to our knowledge, to support or refute this finding.  therefore, we 


4    planned an investigation to assess whether depression or the use of antidepressants alters the risk  of cdi.  we tested these hypotheses using two distinct but complementary approaches.  first, we  assembled longitudinal data from a nationally-representative sample of older americans so that  these relationships could be assessed in a more generalizable population.  second, we utilized a  clinical database of adults admitted to an academic hospital so that details regarding  antidepressant use would be available.         methods  study 1  we conducted a longitudinal study to determine population rates of cdi in individuals with and  without depression and to evaluate the association between depression and cdi.  subjects were  participants in the nationally-representative health and retirement study (hrs) which is an  ongoing longitudinal study of older americans.  details regarding the study design of the hrs  and subject characteristics have been published.13  households were selected using multistage  area probability sampling from the national sample frame, with random selection of eligible  individuals within the household.  subjects were interviewed every two years, from 1992 to the  present.  data from the interviews were linked to files from the centers for medicare and  medicaid services (cms), years 1991-2007, for fee-for-service beneficiaries.  the cms  standard analytical files used were the inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, carrier  (part b), home health agency, and denominator files.      cdi was determined from a physician’s diagnosis of c. difficile infection (icd-9-cm code  008·45) recorded in inpatient, outpatient, carrier, skilled nursing facility or home health 


5    agency files.  this captured both outpatient and inpatient diagnoses of cdi.  the positive and  negative predictive values of the icd-9-cm code for identifying cdi have been previously  reported as 87% and 96%, respectively.14  depression was determined from a physician’s  diagnosis of major depression (icd-9-cm codes 296.2x, 296.3x, 300.4, 311) at any time prior to  a diagnosis of cdi.  we also captured a wider group of patients with “depressive disorders”  which included brief or prolonged depressive reactions, adjustment reaction with anxiety and  depression, depressive type psychosis, chronic depressive personality disorder, bipolar affective  disorder with depression, neurotic depression, depressive disorder (not elsewhere classified), as  well as major depression (icd-9-cm codes 296.2x, 296.3x, 296.5, 298.0, 300.4, 301.12, 309.0,  309.1, 309.28, 311, v79.0) diagnosed at any time prior to the diagnosis of cdi.  a visit to a  psychiatrist was determined from the carrier (individual provider) file using berenson-eggers  type of service (betos) code m5b (evaluation and management by a specialist – psychiatry).   other items related to depression were determined from the initial interview of the hrs.  the  questions were, “during the past week, did you feel sad?”  and “did a doctor ever tell you that  you had emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems?”  we also assessed marital status at the  time of the first interview (married or partnered, divorced or separated, single, widowed).  since  household information was available, we extracted data regarding the number of people in the  household at the time of the first interview.    information was also extracted from the hrs regarding year of birth, gender, race, ethnicity,  region of residence (northeast, midwest, south, west), body mass index (kg/m2) at the time of  the first interview, smoking status at the time of the first interview (never, former, current), end- stage renal disease at the time of the first interview, and diagnoses of crohn’s disease, irritable 


6    bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease (prior to the first cdi diagnosis for those  with cdi).  we anticipated that some individuals would have greater contact with physicians and  medical services and, therefore, we also calculated the number of infection-related visits  (inpatient and outpatient) and the total number of medical-related visits (inpatient and outpatient)  over the entire period of observation for each subject.  number of infection-related visits was the  crude proxy for exposure to antibiotics.  missing values were imputed for the variables race  (n=37), ethnicity (n=3), region of residence (n=28), body mass index (n=30) and smoking status  (n=91).  calendar year of the first interview was also included to account for secular trends.    survey-weighted population-based rates of cdi (number of individuals with the diagnosis of  cdi per 100,000 person-years of observation) were calculated for individuals with and without  major depression.  the rates were stratified by subject characteristics (age, gender, race,  ethnicity, body mass index, education and region of residence).  survey-weighted logistic  regression (svy: logistic) was used to assess the association between depression and cdi, offset  by the natural log of the person-years under observation, after adjustment for year of birth  (centered), gender, race, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, end-stage renal disease, crohn’s  disease, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, number of infection-related  visits, and total number of medical-related visits. alpha was set at 0.05, 2-tailed.      study 2  a hospital-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the association between  antidepressant medications and hospital-acquired cdi.  subjects were all adult patients (18 years  or older) hospitalized in the university of michigan health system (umhs) from august 2010 


7    through february 2012 who had their stools tested for c. difficile.  stool was tested for c.  difficile by the umhs clinical microbiology laboratory. testing was performed on stools using  the c. diff quik chek complete® test for glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) antigen and  toxins a or b (techlab, inc., blacksburg, va).  all antigen/toxin discordant stool tests were  subjected to analysis for the tcdb gene by real-time pcr (bd geneohm™ cdiff assay; franklin  lakes, new jersey).  since hospital-acquired infection was of interest, patients admitted for  reason of c. difficile (principal diagnosis of cdi) were excluded.  cases were patients who tested  positive for cdi >48 hours after admission and controls were patients who tested negative for  cdi >48 hours after admission.  since cdi testing is usually ordered for symptomatic patients  (e.g., antibiotic-associated diarrhea), cases and controls were suspected a priori to be fairly  concordant on these general characteristics.  for individuals with multiple c. difficile tests, the  first test was used for purposes of this study.  data regarding patient demographics,  comorbidities and medications (prior to the date of stool collection for cdi testing) were  extracted from the electronic hospital data system.  detailed information was available regarding  the dosages and dates in which medications were given to each patient.        to assess differences in patient characteristics by case-control status, pearson’s chi-squared test  for categorical data, student t-test for differences in mean age, and kruskal-wallis test for  differences in length of stay prior to stool collection were utilized.  unconditional logistic  regression was used to assess the association between antidepressant use and cdi with and  without adjustment for age, gender, race, antibacterial medications, proton pump inhibitors,  histamine-2 receptor antagonists, statins, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, crohn’s  disease and ulcerative colitis.   


8      finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the case-control study using different controls.   we conducted a case-crossover study in which each patient served as his/her own control.  this  was done to evaluate differences in antidepressants while controlling for past history of  depression.  it incorporates a within-person comparison whereby the use of medications is  compared over different time periods for the same patient and therefore, it can be used to  separate the effects of the antidepressants from the effects of the disease itself (pathophysiology  of depression).  such an approach also controls for factors that are difficult to capture, such as  genetic profile and past dietary habits.  umhs hospitalizations in which hospital-acquired cdi  occurred (n=406) were compared with subsequent hospitalizations (n=949) for the same patient  in which cdi did not occur (july 2009 through june 2012).  odds ratios were calculated using a  conditional logit model for panel data (clogit), offset by the natural log of the time at risk for  infection (length of stay for hospitalizations without cdi; length of time from admission to stool  collection for positive c. difficile for hospitalizations with cdi). statistical analyses were  performed by using stata/mp 11·2 (statacorp lp, college station, tx, usa).  alpha was set at  0.05, 2-tailed.  the studies received human subjects approval at the university of michigan.   since retrospective electronic data were utilized for the studies, patient consent was waived.    results  study 1  among the 16,781 participants in the linked hrs-cms database, the mean age at the time of the  first interview was 67.9 years (sd, 10.6) and 56.2% were women (table 1).  at baseline, the  majority were either overweight (bmi 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) or obese (bmi >30 kg/m2).  of the 


9    16,781 subjects, there were 404 individuals diagnosed with cdi at least once in their medicare  records.  of the 404 people diagnosed with cdi, 142 (35%) had a diagnosis of major depression  and 150 (37%) had a diagnosis of a depressive disorder prior to cdi.   the rates of cdi in the  reference population (fee-for-service medicare population in the us) are given in table 1,  stratified by major depression.  the rate of cdi was 282.9 per 100,000 person-years in those  with depression and 197.1 per 100,000 person-years in those without depression.      after adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities and frequency of medical visits,  there was a 36% increased odds of developing cdi in individuals with major depression  compared to those without (table 2).  the findings were similar for depressive disorders (or,  1.35), feeling sad (or, 1.41) and emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems (or, 1.47).  older  americans who were widowed were significantly more likely to develop cdi; the odds of cdi  were 54% greater in older adults who were widowed compared to those who were married.   being divorced or separated was significantly associated with cdi in the unadjusted model but  was not in the fully adjusted model (p=0.072).  developing cdi was also more common in older  adults who lived alone.  individuals who lived with others had 25% decreased odds of  developing cdi compared to those who lived alone.      study 2  in study 2, there were 4047 adult patients who had their stools tested for c. difficile while  hospitalized within the umhs from 1 august 2010 through 29 february 2012.  of these  subjects, 468 tested positive (cases) and 3579 tested negative (controls).  characteristics of the  patients are given in table 3 and demonstrate that the cases and controls were similar with regard 


10    to age, gender, race, type of admission, number of days from admission to the time of stool  collection for testing, and use of various medications prior to the stool collection.  as seen in  table 3, 83.8% of the cases and 82.6% of the controls received antibiotics (p=0.530).  we also  had data regarding both antibiotics and antidepressants.  in this study, 82.8% of those receiving  antidepressants were given antibiotics and 82.7% of those not receiving antidepressants were  given antibiotics (p=0.957).        certain antidepressants were significantly related to c. difficile infection (table 4).  the odds of  testing positive for c. difficile were twice as great in patients who received mirtazapine than in  those who did not (or, 2.14).  for each dose of mirtazapine given, the odds of testing positive  for c. difficile increased by 8%.  there was also an association between fluoxetine and testing  positive for c. difficile, with an odds ratio of 1.92 after adjustment.  for each dose of fluoxetine  received, the odds of testing positive increased by 6%.  other selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors, besides fluoxetine, were not significantly associated with a positive cdi test.  of the  tricyclic antidepressants, each dose of nortriptyline was associated with an 11% increase in the  odds of testing positive for c. difficile, although the odds ratio for use (yes/no) was not  significant at the 0.05 alpha level (p=0.062). the remaining antidepressants were not associated  with a positive c. difficile test.          in a secondary analysis, we considered whether interactions between antidepressants could alter  the risk of developing cdi.  there was a significant interaction between mirtazapine and  trazodone (p=0.040 for the interaction term).  when a patient received both of these  antidepressants, the odds of a positive c. difficile test were 5.72 times greater than in individuals 


11    receiving neither of these drugs (95% ci: 2.01, 16.26; p=0.001).  of patients receiving  mirtazapine only, 21.2% had a positive c. difficile test.  of patients receiving trazodone only,  fewer patients (13.6%) had a positive test.  of patients receiving both mirtazapine and trazodone,  43.7% subsequently had a positive c. difficile test.      in a sensitivity analysis using a case-crossover design whereby patients (n=406) served as their  own controls, the interaction between mirtazapine and trazodone remained significant (p=0.010)  after adjustment for antibacterial medications, statins, immunosuppressant medications, red  blood cell transfusions, proton pump inhibitors, and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (table 5).   the odds of cdi were greater during hospitalizations in which the patients received mirtazapine  with trazodone compared to hospitalizations in which these same patients did not receive these  two antidepressants.  however, the attributable risk associated with these two drugs was small  since there were only 1.25% of the hospitalizations in which patients received both of these  antidepressants.         discussion:  our findings suggest that depression and/or the use of specific antidepressants are associated  with developing cdi.  data from a nationally-representative sample of older americans  demonstrate that population-based rates (which include both community-acquired and hospital- acquired disease) are greater in individuals with major depression and depressive disorders, as  well as in people who reported feeling sad, or having emotional, nervous or psychiatric  problems, after adjustment for confounders.  in addition, widowed persons and those living alone  were significantly more likely to develop cdi.  results from our clinical study indicate that there 


12    may be certain antidepressants that impart greater risk of cdi, in particular, the combination of  mirtazapine with trazodone.  such effects were independent of antibiotic use.      there is experimental and epidemiologic evidence to support the hypothesis that depression and  bereavement result in changes in the gastrointestinal system.7-10,15-17   in a mouse model,  depression (i.e., maternal separation) was shown to result in colitis and a greater severity of  colitis.10  in humans, pyrosequencing analysis of fecal microbiota of depressed patients showed  distinct bacterial phylotypes compared to those found in patients without depression.16   moreover, patients with depressive symptoms exhibit greater and more prolonged inflammatory  responses after antigen challenge than individuals without depressive symptoms, suggesting that  depression may result in immune dysregulation.18  bereavement has also been shown to decrease  neutrophil superoxide production in older adults19 and to reduce the functional activity of natural  killer cells.20  it is possible that the physiologic sequelae of depression itself, and not  antidepressants per se, may be associated with cdi risk.      it has been suggested that the mechanisms underlying the brain-gut axis may be bidirectional.21- 23  in a 12-year prospective study, the relationship between anxiety, depression and functional  gastrointestinal disorders appeared bidirectional in that psychiatric disorders predicted  gastrointestinal disease and vice versa.21  a population-based longitudinal study in the  netherlands found similar results; the risk of developing severe bowel disease was significantly  higher in individuals with previous depression, and the risk of developing depression was  significantly higher in individuals who previously had severe bowel disease.22  the authors  concluded that depression and severe non-cancerous bowel disease were “varying expressions of 


13    a partly shared aetiological process.”23  animal studies have suggested similar effects, with the  possibility that this interplay may begin in early life.23,24  our studies suggest that depression,  widowhood, living alone, and the use of antidepressant medications preceded the onset of cdi.   we found, in the nationally representative sample, that 35% of those who developed c. difficile  infection were diagnosed with major depression prior to the infection.  however, we did not have  the complete medical history of the subjects prior to the entry into these studies and therefore,  cannot be certain whether cdi pre-dated entry into our studies for some of the subjects.  it is  possible that there is a lifelong liaison between the gut microbiota and neurologic response to  external stimuli.       in our population-based study 1, individuals with major depression had rates of c. difficile  infection that were consistently elevated across all age groups (table 1).  for people without  major depression, the rates of c. difficile infection increased with age.  note that the rate of c.  difficile was 332.9/100,000 person-years in the youngest age group in those with depression.  it  was 301.0/100,000 person-years in the oldest age group for those without depression.  if  infection with c. difficile is a crude indicator of gut health, it would appear that the microbiota of  people with depression would be more similar to that of the very aged.  studies of the microbiota  of older adults generally show less diversity – particularly those who live in long-term residential  care as compared with community dwellers.25    the relationship between depression and inflammatory bowel disease is well known.11,12,26  a  strong association between antidepressants and inflammatory pouch syndrome has also been  shown (adjusted odds ratio of 4·17; p=0·0002).27  because of this, we adjusted for crohn’s 


14    disease and ulcerative colitis in our studies and the relationship between depression and cdi  remained.  this may indicate that mechanisms underlying colitis due to cdi and colitis due to  inflammatory bowel disease demonstrate commonality, both involving host immune response  and gut microbiota; when considered independently, each of these types of colitis is associated  with depression.      we cannot completely discern whether it is the pathophysiology of depression itself or the  treatment for depression that is the major driver of these findings.  in the case-control study, we  categorized the antidepressants by mechanism of action but this categorization did not perfectly  discriminate between those drugs which were associated with higher cdi risk from those that  were not.  it is widely appreciated that the mechanisms of action of many antidepressants are  complex and all effects (both attributable to intended and side effects) are not fully characterized.   many of the antidepressants work by altering serotonin levels and, in the animal model, ghia and  colleagues found that serotonin plays a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis.28  yet, even  antidepressants within the same general class may have slightly different actions; for example,  fluoxetine has a longer half-life than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and has a  greater incidence of weight loss and stimulant effects.29    it is also possible that inter-patient  variation in genes encoding for serotonin receptors may play a role in mediating responses to  therapy.  for example, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of older patients taking  mirtazapine versus paroxetine, side effects were strongly associated with the htr2a c/c  genotype in those receiving paroxetine but there was no effect with mirtazapine – suggesting that  underlying genetic markers can impact the mechanism of action as well.30    in our investigation,  the case-crossover design provided some insights regarding discrimination between effects due 


15    to the pathophysiology of depression per se versus those due to specific anti-depressants.  in this  study, personal history of depression was, by design, held constant because of the within-person  comparison and therefore, any difference found in antidepressant use was not due to a history of  depression.  in effect, we measured drug use at different times (hospitalizations) in the same  individual.  in these analyses, we found that taking most types of antidepressants did not affect  the likelihood of developing c. difficile infection.  however, in a small group of patients, there  was a significantly elevated risk of c. difficile infection when taking both mirtazapine and  trazodone together.  the use of trazodone alone appeared protective but when combined with  mirtazapine, the risk was elevated.  larger studies are necessary for confirmation of these  findings.  however, this only occurred in a minority of patients with c. difficile infection which  suggests that, for most patients, there are underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of depression  that result in their increased risk of c. difficile infection – independent of antidepressant use.      while antibiotic use is closely associated with c. difficile infection, it is not evident that the link  between depression and c. difficile infection is due to increased physician prescriptions for  antibiotics in individuals with depression.  in study 2, we had a tightly-matched group of  controls to cases with respect to antibiotic use.  all subjects were individuals whose stool  samples were tested for c. difficile, which were ordered when antibiotic-associated diarrhea was  evident.   we found that 83.8% of the cases and 82.6% of the controls received antibiotics  (p=0.530).  furthermore, 82.8% of those receiving antidepressants were given antibiotics and  82.7% of those not receiving antidepressants were given antibiotics (p=0.957).  adjustment for  antibiotic use in the regression models (as well as for the number of doses of antibiotics) did not  change the results.   


16      our investigation was limited by its observational design, especially for the assessment of  antidepressants, since effects of medication are best addressed through trials.  however, cdi is  not a common outcome and a trial of such unintended effects may not be feasible.  although the  relationship between antidepressants and cdi was first reported in a study conducted in two  hospitals,5 unfortunately the types of antidepressants were not listed and therefore, we cannot  adequately assess the similarity of results across hospitals.  in study 1, the use of a nationally- representative sample which captured both outpatient visits and inpatient stays over an extended  period of time (17 years maximum) was a strength for the assessment of depression, widowhood  and other factors in which randomization is not possible.       a limitation of study 1 is the use of physician diagnoses to detect depression which may  underestimate the true frequency of this disease.  however, data from the health and retirement  study contains additional information beyond physician diagnoses.  information was available  from self-report by participants during biennial interviews.  the variables shown in table 2  relate to depression measured in different ways and the odds ratios all tend to show a similar  pattern.  for example, the patient’s report of feeling sad (irrespective of a physician’s diagnosis)  was significantly associated with c. difficile infection.  the odds ratio was 1.41 (p=0.008) which  parallels the findings for a physician’s diagnosis of major depression (or=1.36, p=0.016).   moreover, if underestimation of depression is present through missed diagnoses, it is likely to be  nondifferential misclassification.  that is, the under-reporting of depression could occur in  people who have c. difficile infection as well as in people who do not have c. difficile infection.   there is currently no established link between depression and c. difficile in the medical literature 


17    whereby physicians across the country would link these two conditions.  when such  nondifferential misclassification occurs, the odds ratio tends to be pulled towards the null.  so, if  under-diagnosis of depression does occur, we would expect that the true (reference population)  odds ratio would be greater than 1.36.       another concern may be testing bias.  testing bias would occur if the ordering of a test for c.  difficile occurs at different rates in persons with and without depression.  in study 2, participants  were all patients who were tested for c. difficile during a given time period because of symptoms  evidenced during hospitalization – that is, antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  since depression has  not been previously correlated with c. difficile in the medical literature or in general clinical  practice, we do not suspect that there was differential testing based on this specific diagnosis.          unfortunately, questions regarding dietary intake were not asked of all participants in the health  and retirement study as a part of the ongoing biennial interviews.  nor do we have dietary  intake information on the hospitalized patients in study 2.  therefore, the influence of habitual  diet on both depression and c. difficile cannot be assessed in our studies.  there was one aspect  of our investigation, however, in which we were able to control for past dietary intake.  in the  sensitivity study of the hospitalized patients (study 2), we conducted a case-crossover study  whereby each person was compared to him/herself.  in this instance, past dietary habits (prior to  july 2009) were held constant; such habits are the same because the person is the same. when  diet was held constant, patients receiving mirtazapine with trazodone were at greater risk of  developing cdi.  however, if some of these patients began eating differently after july 2009, 


18    such differences could not be measured.  overall, the impact of diet on both depression and c.  difficile infection would be an interesting area for further study.      conclusions:  given the rise of cdi, especially among older individuals,31 elucidating the modifiable risk  factors for this often-fatal illness is an important patient safety issue. our complementary studies  reveal that adults with depression and those that use specific antidepressants appear more likely  to experience cdi.  widowhood and living alone were also associated with cdi.  clinicians  prescribing antimicrobials to patients with depression should be aware of the possible increased  risk of cdi in this patient population.         list of abbreviations:    cdi: clostridium difficile infection  hrs: health and retirement study  cms: centers for medicare and medicaid services  umhs: university of michigan health system  ci: confidence interval
