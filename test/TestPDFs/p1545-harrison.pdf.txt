    created (table 1). to identify perceptual differences, we  employed a simple interface that presented two progress  bars to the participant (figure 1), each of which took five  seconds to complete. progress bars were run sequentially –  when the first one finished, the second one began. sequen- tial, rather than parallel presentation was necessary to hide  the fact that the progress bars were actually the same dura- tion. although five seconds is a somewhat short duration  for a progress bar, it was a necessary trade off to run the  number of trials we desired and still maintain user attention  for the complete experiment. however, as you will see in  discussion of the results from our final experiment, we be- lieve that these types of effects can scale to at least some- what longer durations.  after watching the two progress bars run to completion,  participants selected whether they believed the first pro- gress bar was faster, the second progress bar was faster, or  that the progress bars were equal in duration. the next trial  began once an answer was provided. participants could  replay the progress bars if desired.   all distinct ordered pairings of the five pulsation behaviors  were shown to participants, for total of 25 trials. this in- cluded testing behaviors against themselves, and both or- derings of every pair, the results of which are combined to  control for order effects. presentation order was also  randomized to control for time order errors (see [3], p52).   results and discussion  we employed a simple preference metric [4] to compare  the performance of different behaviors, which is calculated  as an average of the following individual scores: +1 if the  first behavior is preferred (i.e. perceived to be faster), -1 if  the second is preferred, and 0 if the participant believed the  two to be equal in duration. for example, in 40 compari- sons of fast increasing vs. slow decreasing, 16 partici- pants felt the former was faster, 6 participants felt the latter  was faster, and 18 believed the two progress bars were  equal in duration. thus, the mean preferences score is (16 –  6) / 40 = 0.25. the positive value indicates a preference  towards fast increasing. to derive our statistical measures,  we employed a two-sided sign test of the null hypothesis  that each function was equally likely to be preferred.   there were several statistically significant differences in  the preferences between the various pulsation behaviors.  figure 2 provides a partial order of these relationships, and  clearly illustrates the preference towards behaviors with  increasing pulsation frequencies. this result is confirmed  when results are grouped by behavior type – behaviors with  increasing frequency are significantly preferred over those  with constant or decreasing frequencies (p<0.05 and  p<0.001 respectively). the most preferred behavior overall  was fast increasing, with a mean preference score of 0.21.  study 2: ribbed progress bars  ribbed progress bars have been a stable visual element of  mac os x since its earliest releases (figure 3). these pro- gress bars, like others, progress from left tor right, but also  feature an animated ribbing which moves from right to left.  the visual qualities of ribbing are well suited to take ad- vantage of induced motion effects, which state that motion  perception is not absolute, but rather relative to the sur- rounding visual context [6,10]. thus, ribbing moving in the  opposite direction to the progress creates an illusion of in- creased velocity, which in turn, alters our perception of  progress bar duration.  study design  to investigate how animated ribbing affects perception of  progress bar duration, we devised seven ribbed behaviors,  described in table 2. we used the same participants as the  pulsating progress bar study. figure 4 illustrates the graphi- cal appearance of our ribbed progress bars (although not  animated). using the same study interface (figure 1), we  presented all 49 distinct ordered pairs of the seven ribbed  behaviors. as before, this included testing behaviors  against themselves, and both orderings of any given pair,  the results of which are combined to control for order ef- fects. presentation order was also randomized.  results and discussion  participants had strong preferences among the seven ribbed  behaviors (figure 5). when grouped by direction of rib- bing, backwards-moving behaviors were significantly pre- ferred over both still and forward ones (p<0.001 for both).  when grouped by change in velocity, accelerating behav- iors (both forward and backwards) were significantly pre- ferred over still ribbing (i.e., no velocity, p<0.05), while  decelerating behaviors are significantly preferred over both  still and constant velocity ribbing (like that seen in mac    figure 3. progress bar used in mac osx.      figure 4. ribbed progress bar used in the study.      figure 2.

    osx) (p<0.05 for both).   progress bars with backwards-moving ribbing that were  either accelerating or decelerating performed the strongest.  the theory of induced motion would suggest that back- wards accelerating ribbing would be ideal, providing the  highest relative velocity of any behavior (264 pixels per  second near the conclusion - a particular salient area due to  peak and end effects [1]). indeed, although not statistically  significant, backwards accelerating is slightly preferred  over backwards decelerating (a weak preference score of  0.1). however, if the preference scores against all other  behaviors are averaged, backwards decelerating has the  greatest overall preference (0.34 vs. 0.29). additionally,  amongst the statistically significant relationships, back- wards decelerating had both more significant and higher  magnitude preferences (figure 5).   study 3: pulsating and ribbed compared  the previous two studies identified which pulsating and  ribbed behaviors were the strongest within their respective  groups. however, the results offered no insight into how  these visual augmentations compared against each other or  standard, solid-color progress bars. thus, a new study was  devised that pitted three types of progress bar against each  other: a standard, solid-color progress bar, the best- performing pulsating progress bar (fast increasing), and the  best-performing ribbed progress bar (backwards decelerat- ing).    study design  we recruited 10 participants (5 female, mean age 19) to  evaluate the relative perceived duration of the three pro- gress bars at two different durations, 5 and 15 seconds. the  latter time was included to explore if the perceptual effects  scaled to somewhat longer intervals (both durations are  well below vierordt’s threshold [12], minimizing percep- tual distortion between the two conditions. nonetheless, to  control for any e.g., attenuation effects [2], we do not com- pare results across durations). each unique ordered pair of  progress bars was presented to participants twice, for a total  of 18 trials. data from repeated trials was combined, as  were results from different presentation orderings of the  same pair (to control for order effects). the trial order was  also randomized. the study was completed for both 5- and  15-second durations (36 comparisons in total) using the  same interface as the previous two studies.  results and discussion  there was only one preference approaching significance  amongst the three progress bars at the 5-second duration:  the progress bar with increasing pulsation was more likely  to be perceived as having a shorter duration (i.e., faster)  than the standard, solid-color progress bar (p<0.1). how- ever, the results from the 15-second duration comparisons  showed that both the ribbed and pulsating progress bars  were significantly preferred over the standard, solid-color  progress bar (p<0.05). in trials that compared ribbed with  pulsating progress bars, ribbed was slightly preferred.  when combing results from the 5- and 15-second duration  tests, 30 trials indicated a preference for the pulsating be- havior, 33 indicated a preference the animated ribbing, and  17 trials noted no preference (equal duration).   study 4: perceived performance magnitude  our previous studies indicated which visual behaviors led  to a perception of decreased progress bar duration. how- ever, they did not directly measure how much faster they  were. in response, we initiated a final round of experimen- tation that was explicitly designed to gauge the magnitude  of the perceptual effects we had seen.   study design  for our final study, we selected a progress bar that featured  backwards decelerating ribbing, as this was slightly pre- ferred over the pulsating behavior in study three. this was  compared against a standard, solid color progress bar. the  test interface, instead of simply recording participant’s  preferences, used the responses to warp the duration of the  ribbed progress bar (the solid color progress bar had a fixed  duration to act as a control). specifically, if a user felt the  ribbed progress bar was faster, its duration was extended  (to slow it down). conversely, if the user felt the ribbing  was slower, the duration was reduced (to speed it up).  equal responses left the duration unchanged. the goal was  to allow participants to converge to a duration where they  believed the two progress bars “felt” equal. (for an ex- tended discussion on method of adjustment experiments,  please refer to [3], “difference thresholds”).  as before, two progress bars durations were evaluated: 5  and 15 seconds. the latter was included as a preliminary  test to see if the effects extended to longer periods (already  partially demonstrated in the study 3). we piloted with  longer durations, but it was clear that participants’ attention  suffered tremendously. we presented both orderings of  each duration (solid-color first and ribbed first), yielding  four distinct experimental conditions, for which duration  warping was handled independently. results from the two  orderings were combined at the end of the study to control  for order effects.   we recruited 16 participants (6 female, mean age 22). par- ticipants had eight rounds to find a perceptual equilibrium  for each of the four conditions. this was repeated twice  (with data averaged together) for a total of 64 trials (four    figure 5. statistically significant preferences between  the seven ribbed behaviors. line styles: dashed  (p<0.1), thin (p<0.05), thick (p<0.01). mean prefer- ence scores are labeled on the edges.    chi 2010: pixels and perception april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1547


    conditions of eight rounds each, done twice), the order of  which was randomized to control for time order errors.   the time that was added or subtracted to the ribbed pro- gress bar duration decreased linearly each round, allowing  for increasingly fine tuning. this value started at 25% of  the total original duration, and then dropped by 5% each  subsequent round. for the final three rounds, a fixed value  of 2.5% of the original duration was used. in the first  round, the “equal speeds” answer button was disabled,   forcing participants to select either the standard, solid color  progress bar or the ribbed progress bar as being faster. this  helped to kick off the convergence (participants could in- vert the relationship if, e.g., they chose incorrectly, in as  little as two rounds).    results and discussion  figure 6 displays the results of the duration matching trials.  in both cases, the backwards decelerating ribbing signifi- cantly increased perceived performance (p<0.001). on av- erage, a 5 second solid color progress bar felt perceptually  equivalent to a 5.61 second ribbed progress bar (se=0.14),  which is 12.2% longer in actual duration. a similar effect  was seen in the case of the 15-second duration tests, where  the ribbed progress bar was converged to an average of  16.75 seconds (se=0.45), an 11.7% increase in actual time.  the similarity in the magnitude of the two results suggests  these effects might scale linearly to longer durations, but  additional tests will be needed to confirm this.    another interesting result is that unlike the 5-second dura- tion results, which level off quickly (by roughly round  four), the 15-second results show a clearly upward trajec- tory, even at round eight. it is possible that the longer dura- tion necessitates additional rounds to find a perceptual  equilibrium. if this trend does exist, it would suggest an  even greater perceptual performance effect is at play, and  possibly that the effect magnifies as duration increases.  conclusion  in this paper, we have explored two classes of visual aug- mentations that could be applied to progress bars: a pulsat- ing effect and an animated ribbing. we described the re- sults from four studies that sought to identify which visual  behaviors could improve the perceived performance of a  progress bar. in our final experiment, we took our best per- forming behavior, a backwards moving and decelerating  ribbed progress bar, and compared its perceived perform- ance to that of standard, solid color progress bar. this was  achieved using a special interface that manipulated the ac- tual duration of the ribbed progress bar, allowing users to  find a perceptual equilibrium. results show that the se- lected visual augmentation caused users to believe it had a  duration equal to that of a progress bar 11% longer in ac- tual time. in other words, visually augmented progress bars  could be used to make processes appear 11% faster, when  in reality, their duration remains unchanged.    acknowledgements  this work was supported in part by grants iis-0713509 and  iis-0840766 from the national science foundation.  references  1. allan, l.g. “the perception of time.” perception and psycho- physics, vol. 26, 1997, 340-354.  2. brown, s.w. ‚”the attenuation effect in timing: counteracting  dual-task interference with time-judgment skill training."   perception, 37(5), 2008, 712-724.   3. gescheider, g.a. psychophysics: the fundamentals. 3rd edi- tion. lawrence erlbaum associates inc., mahwah, nj., 1997.  4. harrison, c., amento, b., kuznetsov, s., and bell, r. rethink- ing the progress bar. in proc. uist '07, 115-118.  5. hildebrandt, m., dix, a., and meyer, h.a. time design. in  chi '04 ext. abst., 1737-1738.  6. kolers, p.a. aspects of motion perception. pergamon press  inc., new york, 1972.  7. mcauley, j.d. on the perception of time as phase: toward  an adaptive-oscillator model of rhythm. phd thesis, indiana  university, bloomington, in, 1995.  8. myers, b.a. the importance of percent-done progress indica- tors for computer-human interfaces. in proc. chi '85, 11-17.   9. seow s. c. designing and engineering time: the psychology  of time perception in software. pearson education, boston,  ma, 2008.  10. schiffman, h.r. sensation and perception: an integrated  approach. 2nd ed. john wiley & sons, new york, 1982.  11. tognazzini, b. principles, techniques, and ethics of stage  magic and their application to human interface design. in  proc. interchi ’93, 355-362.   12. vierordt, k.v. der zeitsinn nach versuchen. tubingen: h.  laupp. 1868, 4-191.    figure 6. results from the perceived performance magnitude experiment.  chi 2010: pixels and perception april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1548
