organizational structure and acculturation   in acquisitions: perspectives of congruence  theory and task interdependence liang-hung lin national kaohsiung university of applied sciences a congruence model of organizational design suggests that the consistency among strategy,  structure, and culture enhances organizational performance. in this study, the author attempts  to understand which strategy-structure and strategy-culture contingencies facilitate superior  postacquisition performance. from the perspective of task interdependence, the author argues  that different acquisition strategies (i.e., unrelated, vertical, related) require different levels of  headquarters centralization and interdivisional integration in the organizational structure, as  well as different degrees of acculturation in the organizational culture. based on input/output  (i/o) analysis, the author develops theoretical measures for different acquisition strategies to  test these arguments. the results from a two-stage model capture the author’s arguments by  using a sample of 154 acquisitions in the taiwanese electronics and information sector. keywords: acquisition integration; organizational structure; acculturation; performance the acquisition–performance relationship assumes that the purpose of acquisitions is to  improve performance (cording, christman, & king, 2008). prior studies on this issue have  addressed two sets of factors that affect acquisition performance. first, acquisition  performance is proposed to depend largely on the acquirer’s acquisition strategy and the  target’s resource characteristics (makri, hitt, & lane, 2010) from the resource-based view  1831 acknowledgments: the author thanks editor michael leiblein and the reviewers for their constructive feedback  and wei-hsin (eugenia) lin for editorial assistance. corresponding author: liang-hung lin, department of international business, national kaohsiung university  of applied sciences, 415 chien kung road, kaohsiung 807, taiwan, republic of china. e-mail: lhlin@cc.kuas.edu.tw journal of management vol. 40 no. 7,  november 2014 1831–1856 doi: 10.1177/0149206312442385 © the author(s) 2012 reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalspermissions.nav  at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1832   journal of management / november 2014 of the firm. second, successful acquisitions are argued to rely on effective organizational  integration of both target and acquirer (barkema & schijven, 2008; puranam, singh, &  chaudhuri, 2009). the literature, however, neglects another factor, the collective effects of  the firm’s acquisition strategy and organizational integration, which, as this study shows,  may advance this study stream by adding new theoretical insights into the important issue of  acquisition performance. although there is widespread agreement on the importance of firms’ acquisition integration  decisions, whether or how these decisions affect acquisition performance remains unclear.  for example, integration and resource reconfiguration are necessary for both target and  acquirer to commercialize resources in a coordinated manner, yet the loss of autonomy that  typically accompanies acquisition integration can be detrimental to the acquired firm’s  capacity for continued innovation (puranam & srikanth, 2007). from an intermediate  perspective, effects of acquisition integration decisions should be contingent on the  acquirer’s acquisition strategy. as suggested by strategy-structure-performance studies  (hill, hitt, & hoskisson, 1992), acquisition strategy determines the level of acquisition  integration because corporate strategy imposes operating requirements. for meeting these  requirements, the administrative structure must provide an adequate climate. based on  thompson’s (1967) theory of task interdependence, recent extensions of the present study  have noted that related and vertical acquisitions enhance acquisition integration through  reciprocal and sequential interdependent value chain activities, whereas unrelated  acquisitions, relying on lower level of integration, can benefit from pooled interdependence  (e.g., aggarwal, siggelkow, & singh, 2011; bailey, leonardi, & chong, 2010). the ideas that acquisition performance can be influenced by proper strategy and integration  choice, though theoretically reasonable, receive little empirical support and thus fail to  predict performance. this failure can be derived from two research gaps in prior literature.  first, effects of strategy and integration choice on acquisition performance are not  simultaneously taken into consideration. second, vertical, related, and unrelated acquisitions  are not carefully differentiated. for the first gap, this study extends the prior literature on  acquisition strategy and performance by including acquisition integration choice regarding  organizational structure and acculturation processes. in response to the tension between  potential benefits and risks associated with firms’ integration choices, i assess comparative  perspective on the performance implication of different acquisition strategy. specifically, i  examine the fundamental arguments of the congruence model of organizational design  (tushman & nadler, 1978), which focuses on the performance implications of the fit among  firms’ acquisition strategy, structure, and acculturation (hill et al., 1992). this study also  recognizes that even though researchers account for the influences of strategy and integration,  endogeneity is an important point that needs to be explained to understand the specific effects  of each component on acquisition performance. if acquisition strategy influences both  organizational integration and acquisition performance, a self-selection bias will occur and  implications drawn from the analyses may be incorrect (e.g., leiblein, reuer, & dalsace,  2002). therefore, to explicitly explain the potential self-selection bias, i employ a series of  two-stage designs that permit an integrative model capturing firms’ acquisition integration  decisions as well as the strategic antecedents of these decisions and their performance  implications. regarding the second gap, i develop theoretical measures for different acquisition   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1833 strategies based on input/output (i/o) analysis. compared to the sic-based measures of  related and unrelated diversification, this study contributes to the literature by introducing a  vertical index for two reasons. one is that the strategic intention of vertical acquisition,  different from that of related and unrelated acquisitions, concerns specialized investments,  which in turn generate productivity gains for the acquirer (kretschmer & puranam, 2008).  the other reason is to reduce classification errors by using the traditional sic construct (fan  & lang, 2000). this study highlights the importance of aligning acquisition strategy with acquisition  integration and controlling endogeneity bias in assessments of acquisition strategy, integration,  and performance outcomes. the contribution of this article is twofold. theoretically, i extend  acquisition studies by means of including integration choice regarding organization structure  and acculturation process and explaining the collective effects of firms’ strategy, structure,  and acculturation on acquisition performance. methodologically, i develop measures of  acquisition type, derived from a detailed i/o analysis of 161 industries. the adoption of a  two-stage model effectively eliminates the potential self-selection bias regarding endogenous  selection of acquisition strategy and integration choice. this empirical study captures my  arguments by using a sample of 154 acquisitions over 7 years in the taiwanese electronics  and information sector. literature review postacquisition integration and performance in the combined firm postacquisition integration, the level of interaction and coordination between the target  and acquiring firms (larsson & finkelstein, 1999), brings the combination of activities within  a common organizational boundary following an acquisition. while interaction postures are  conducive to leveraging tacit knowledge embodied in physical artifacts, coordination postures  provide superior access to the explicit knowledge embodied in documents and procedures  (puranam & srikanth, 2007). as firms are combined within the common administrative  boundaries, acquirers can use common authority, incentives, and processes to enhance  coordination and mutual adaptation to reduce operational costs (datta, 1991). although little empirical literature (e.g., puranam, singh, & zollo, 2006) has examined  whether acquisition integration choice affects performance, numerous case studies have  described the potential advantages and risks of integration. moreover, it is argued that the  acquired firms’ autonomy in structure and culture preserves tacit and socially embedded  technologies (grabner, 2004). however, as autonomy restricts effective coordination, it thus  harms the acquirer in leveraging acquired firms’ technologies. puranam and srikanth (2007:  807), observing that “integration enhances coordination at the expense of autonomy,” identify  two major effects in acquisition integration, namely, coordination effect and loss of autonomy  effect. in general, the coordination effect occurs by means of minimizing functional redundancy  and joining daily activities, which helps the acquirer leverage the target firm’s capability.  moreover, the coordination effect may enhance reciprocal predictability of both sides’ actions  through daily interaction and further strengthen mutual adjustment and adaptation (galbraith,   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1834   journal of management / november 2014 1974). in addition to its effects on organizational structure, integration also shapes the  informal processes (i.e., acculturation) that help to create organizational identity, common  knowledge, and informal communication channels as well as bring the merging entity to  cohesion. however, integration may also incur costs of “loss of autonomy effect” in several  ways. first, the employees of the acquired firm may reduce their motivation and productivity  after acquisition integration. moreover, arguments from agency theory suggest that acquisition  integration may weaken talented employees’ intrinsic motivation of participating in innovative  activities because they are forced to cooperate in other colleagues’ tasks and therefore reduce  their autonomy of concentrating on their own tasks. if free riding and agent opportunism  further weaken the link between effort and reward, talented employees, especially those with  hard-to-measure skills, could possibly leave (kretschmer & puranam, 2008). with regard to  the acquired managers, as they lose their power and authority to make decisions, they may  leave the merged organizations as well (cartwright & cooper, 1994). ultimately, high turnover  among the top management team and loss of human and social resources in the acquired firm  will have a deleterious impact on acquisitions (hambrick & cannella, 1993). also, as  acquisition integration proceeds, the work practices in the acquired firm will change, which  may also alter valuable organizational routines of the target firm and consequently leads to  disruption (puranam et al., 2009). organizational structure and performance in the combined firm chandler (1962) proposed that strategy–performance studies should emphasize the  importance of implementation, for it determines whether a strategy results in superior  performance. this model also suggests that firms should adopt different strategies in their life  cycle to meet objectives of growth and profit. thus, as firms diversify by acquisitions,  superior performance is argued to be the outcome of establishing a correct fit between strategy  and structure (hill et al., 1992). centralized multidivisional (cm-form) structure and  decentralized multidivisional (m-form) structure are regarded as two classic organizational  structures for achieving diversification strategy (e.g., chandler, 1962; harrison, hitt, hoskisson,  & ireland, 2001; hoskisson, hill, & kim, 1993; williamson, 1985). based on williamson’s  (1985) study, a cm-form structure is multidivisional with high headquarters centralization and  high interdivisional integration, whereas an m-form structure has low headquarters centralization  and low interdivisional integration. regarding divisional autonomy, the cm-form headquarters  tend to constrain business-level strategies and operational decisions. in other words, the  headquarters of cm-form firms are highly involved in operational activities of each division.  as hill et al. (1992) argue that related diversified firms should ensure resource sharing and  skill transfer among the headquarters and divisions, a cm-form structure is thus suitable for  related diversification (hoskisson et al., 1993). in the m-form structure, the headquarters, on  one hand, tend to delegate operational decisions to divisions. this extensive autonomy allows  divisions to develop their own management systems and subcultures. on the other hand, the  m-form headquarters must design appropriate incentive and control systems to supervise  divisional performance and reallocate organizational resources to the most promising and  expanding divisions. such an m-form arrangement is argued to be appropriate for unrelated  diversification (hill et al., 1992).  at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1835 effects of acculturation in the combined firm cultural integration, “the creation of positive attitudes toward the new organization and  the emergence of a sense of shared identity and trust among organizational members” (stahl  & voigt, 2008: 162), is argued to be the biggest challenge of acquisitions. as larsson and  finkelstein (1999) have noted, the support from the acquired firm’s employees is contingent  on proper cultural integration or the extent to which they perceive their culture to be  compatible with the acquirer. dissimilar or incompatible cultures may cause feelings of  hostility and significant discomfort, which can hinder the acquired firm’s employees from  committing to and coordinating with the acquirer. besides, stahl and voigt (2008) argue that  the execution of a well-designed cultural integration process is essential to minimize  intercultural friction and capture expected acquisition gains. the concept of acculturation was first introduced by berry (1980), who studied the  cultural integration process of individuals entering different ethnic or national cultures and  afterward referred to acculturation as “the dual process of cultural and psychological change  that takes place as a result of contact between two or more cultural groups and their individual  members” (berry, 2005: 698). moreover, acculturation involves changes of social structure  and cultural practices at the group level and changes of personal behavior at the individual  level. adopting berry’s view of social anthropology, management researchers (e.g.,  nahavandi & malekzadeh, 1988) have proposed that postacquisition culture involves a  dynamic tension between forces of cultural differentiation (the side of the acquired firm) and  forces of organizational integration (the side of the acquirer). larsson and lubatkin (2001:  1574) further define acculturation in acquisitions as the “outcome of a cooperative process  whereby the belief, assumptions and values of two previous independent work forces form a  jointly determined culture” and find out that whether acculturation is achieved depends on  how well the acquirer manages the acculturation process. this process also helps to explain  pressures of conforming to the acquirer’s values and practices on the acquired employees,  and reasons why the acquired employees tend to resist such cultural pressures. in addition,  aspects of cultural integration, such as trust and mutual respect, will make capability transfer  and resource sharing easier if a cultural integration is well executed (berry, 2005). the  acculturation process, nonetheless, is not always identical in all acquisition types. for  example, in unrelated and vertical acquisitions where the domain and industry of two firms  are dissimilar, the acquired firm is expected to maintain autonomous in culture, unaffected by  the acquirer’s culture (larsson & finkelstein, 1999). as in related acquisitions, instead of  having autonomy, acquired firms are expected to conform to the acquirer’s culture, for the  acquirer believes that operating profits can be achieved through combination. theory and hypotheses setting task interdependence between target and the acquiring firms in avoidance of possible conflicts between target and acquirer, proper selection of  acquisition integration regarding organizational structure and acculturation process is  challenging for the acquirer (puranam & srikanth, 2007). as the execution of a well-designed   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1836   journal of management / november 2014 integration process depends on the nature of task interdependence between target and  acquirer, the needed extent of integration in different types of task interdependence have  been central to theories concerning how to organize the combined organization after  acquisition (kretschmer & puranam, 2008). interdependence, the “value of performing one  activity depends on how another activity is performed” (puranam et al., 2009: 315), is  argued to affect people’s action by determining the necessary extent of interaction,  consultation, and material exchange. along these lines, task interdependence is defined as  the manner in which divisions interact and depend on one another for resources and  knowledge to accomplish their tasks (bailey et al., 2010). from a coordination perspective, information processing activities and decisions on  allocating tasks among people enable mutual adaptation between acquiring and target  individuals. as long as employees of both sides can reach agreement through communication,  decision making, and task implementation, they can continue their respective tasks and  believe that the other’s task will be aligned to their own. integration in acquisition presents  the extent to which the target’s functions are linked to or aligned with the equivalent functions  of the acquirer (zollo & singh, 2004). drawing on thompson’s (1967) pioneering work, the  required extent of integration relies on degrees of task interdependence and capability transfer  necessary for acquisition implementation. the model of pooled, sequential, and reciprocal  interdependence indicates different levels of integration required in acquisitions, in which  reciprocal interdependence is suggested to require the highest degree of integration, whereas  pooled interdependence requires the lowest (puranam et al., 2009). acquisition strategy and organizational structure in an unrelated acquisition, work does not flow between acquired and acquiring firms. even  though working independently, the acquired firm, as one part of the combined organization,  contributes to the common good of the organization. in other words, the acquired unit behaves  as a self-contained division “to the extent and degree that the conditions for carrying out its  activities are independent of what is done in the other organizational units” (march & simon,  1958: 28). when divisions (the target firms) are self-contained, each division should have its  own set of support functions and control systems (chandler, 1962) because a centralized set  of support functions and control systems cannot satisfy the needs of different product divisions.  the benefits of unrelated acquisition are mainly gained through pooled interdependence,  which requires only minimal integration. as few information processing activities and day-to- day coordination are demanded among self-contained units, unrelated acquisitions have the  lowest need for coordinating efforts of both merged firms. this also allows the acquired firm  to have considerable autonomy and frees top managers of the acquirer from being involved in  the daily activities of the acquired firm. since unrelated acquisitions require high degrees of divisional autonomy and low degrees  of coordination, an m-form structure is argued to be appropriate (hill et al., 1992).  decentralized divisional managers, on one hand, are given autonomy by the headquarters for  relevant operational decisions. on the other hand, the headquarters establish objective  financial criteria for divisional performance, based on which each division is offered different   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1837 levels of incentive (hill et al., 1992). on this competitive basis, the headquarters can thus  adopt the least cost behavior and capital flow for high-yield uses. to conclude, an m-form  structure in unrelated acquisitions avoids performance ambiguities and bureaucratic costs  that hinder divisional and organizational performance. thus, hypothesis 1a: the interaction between unrelated acquisition and the degree of headquarters  centralization is negatively related to postacquisition performance. hypothesis 1b: the interaction between unrelated acquisition and the degree of interdivisional  integration is negatively related to postacquisition performance. vertical acquisition strategy is based on sequential interdependence where resources flow  unidirectionally from one division to the other (hoskisson et al., 1993). this is a high level  of interdependence because the merged division and the acquirer’s preexisting divisions  exchange resources and depend on others to have a better performance. vertical acquisitions  often provide opportunity for the acquirer to integrate resources and knowledge across  different value chain activities. as benefits of vertical integration come from reducing  transaction costs (williamson, 1985), building entry barriers, and enriching product  portfolios, firms usually invest in specialized assets (e.g., physical and human resource  specificities). these specialized investments typically increase the specialization of  organizational subunits, indicating that different divisions take on different subsets of  organizational tasks (kretschmer & puranam, 2008). specialization here refers to the  condition that employees become proficient at dealing with given assignments, whereas  specialized assets refer to investments on specialized devices to reduce cost of production. in  general, as the specialization of tasks progresses, the interdependency of the specialized parts  increases. moreover, divisions across different value chain activities need to be tightly  integrated owing to the need of resources to flow from one operating division to the next  (thompson, 1967). a coordination effect of integration in vertically combined firms occurs  when proper incentives are provided (kretschmer & puranam, 2008). for instance, reward  schemes that emphasize coordination rather than divisional performance can lead to  cooperative behavior across divisions. a coordination effect also arises through shared  experience and culture, so that members of both combined firms are willing to cooperate and  pursue the common goals of the organization. loss of autonomy effect is contrarily slight in  vertical acquisitions because of the fact that the acquirer needs managers of the acquired firm  to operate the business, at least for a time, until the acquirer becomes familiar with the  operations. more important, vertical acquisitions are less likely to incur layoffs of the  acquired employees (harrison et al., 2001). in consideration of sequential interdependence in vertical integration, child (1984) argues  that centralization is necessary to achieve coordination. within the combined firm,  interdivisional coordination is facilitated by three centralized mechanisms: programming,  hierarchy, and feedback (galbraith, 1974; march & simon, 1958). programming involves  interdivisional arrangement and agreement on what (e.g., standards and procedures) and when  (e.g., plans and schedules) actions must be implemented. hierarchical mechanisms (e.g.,  centralized authority) enhance coordination by ordering individuals tasks of coordination  and informing them about how differently those interdependent actors should behave. when   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1838   journal of management / november 2014 daily programming is important, coordination mechanisms such as cross-divisional meetings  and teamwork are necessary to provide feedback on an ongoing basis. such daily feedback  further enables mutual adjustment and adaptation across the target and acquirer. thus,  sequential interdependence in vertical acquisition encourages the headquarters to retain  control over the target and adopt a cm-form structure. hypothesis 2a: the interaction between vertical acquisition and the degree of headquarters  centralization is positively related to postacquisition performance. hypothesis 2b: the interaction between vertical acquisition and the degree of interdivisional  integration is positively related to postacquisition performance. related acquisition strategy concerns the realization of economies of scope associated  with reciprocal interdependence (hoskisson et al., 1993). a coordination effect of integration  between related combined firms can arise in two ways. first, in terms of inputs and outputs  utilization of related activities, tangible (e.g., joint development of shared production) and  intangible (e.g., knowledge transfer) interdependences between target and acquirer are exploited  to achieve organizational tasks. reciprocal interdependence tends to occur in a related combined  organization with what thompson (1967) has described intensive technologies, in which  various products and services in combination are provided to its customers. through  interdivisional integration with sufficient coordination, related acquisitions can contribute to  the acquirer’s goal of expanding its market to other related markets or product lines (cording  et al., 2008). second, a coordination effect of a related acquisition may encompass all possible  coordination effects of a vertical acquisition. for example, the design/manufacturing  relationship (dmr), in which the purpose of sending designs to the manufacturing sector is  to test whether these designs can be manufactured or need further modification, seems to be  a sequential interdependence because products are typically manufactured after being  designed. nevertheless, from a broader perspective, dmr may be involved in new product  development projects, in which not only design and manufacturing but also r&d and  marketing have to be intensively coordinated in a reciprocal fashion. moreover, each of these  divisions will receive feedback from all the other divisions to manufacture a product fulfilling  customer needs. in general, the reciprocal character can be considered as a higher order of  interdependence, which encompasses a lower sequential interdependence. the costs of loss of autonomy in related integration can be understood in two ways. first,  firms of closely divisional interdependence may suffer from performance ambiguities  (harrison et al., 2001). second, it is argued that takeover resistance is more likely to occur in  related acquisitions. because of high degrees of integration, functions of the acquired  organization tend to be aligned or combined with the equivalent functions of the acquirer in  related acquisitions (zollo & singh, 2004). it is thus likely that the acquirer might replace  managers and lay off surplus employees. because knowledge and experience are market and  product specific, the success of market expansion usually depends on the retention of the  target’s managers to understand how to integrate and coordinate the combined organization’s  resources and subsequently turn them into new market opportunities (cording et al., 2008).  given these costs from loss of autonomy, why do acquirers integrate related acquisitions  instead of giving autonomy to related targets? puranam et al.

lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1839 coordination will outweigh costs from loss of autonomy if high levels of interdependence  between tasks underlie the target’s and the acquirer’s capabilities. in general, successful  related acquisitions require intense coordination and functional experts to enhance horizontal  and vertical communication between divisions and headquarters. moreover, the acquirers can  also avoid the loss of autonomy effect by means of establishing a reward scheme, emphasizing  interdivisional coordination instead of divisional performance, and retaining talented  employees of the acquired firms. thus, a cm-form structure meets the strategic requirements  of a related acquisition: tightly coupled divisions controlled by the centralized headquarters. hypothesis 3a: the interaction between related acquisition and the degree of headquarters  centralization is positively related to postacquisition performance. hypothesis 3b: the interaction between related acquisition and the degree of interdivisional  integration is positively related to postacquisition performance. acquisition strategy and postacquisition acculturation in unrelated acquisitions, associated with pooled interdependence, the maintenance of  autonomous operations and business practices should be emphasized in the acquired firms  (hitt, hoskisson, ireland, & harrison, 1991). regarding organizational culture, the acquired  employees wish to preserve their own culture in unrelated acquisitions (larsson & finkelstein,  1999). furthermore, managers in headquarters see themselves as supporters, intending to  further facilitate the development and growth of the acquired firms. as a result, they tend to  minimize interference over the unrelated acquired firms and show tolerance or respect toward  multiculturalism, which refers to “the degree to which an organization values cultural  diversity and is willing to tolerate and encourage it” (nahavandi & malekzadeh, 1988: 83).  in addition to operation and business practices, the acquired firms are permitted to maintain  their values of autonomy and independency, and only a low level of postacquisition  acculturation is necessary. so, hypothesis 4: the interaction between unrelated acquisition and the degree of postacquisition  acculturation is negatively related to postacquisition performance. firms vertically integrate because the division of labor and specialization of productive  activities increase manufacturing productivity. in a vertically merged firm, divisions of  sequential interdependence must devote themselves to corporate performance rather than  divisional performance. flexibility and cost advantages are achieved by combining design  and manufacturing in all value chain activities. to cope with keen competition, vertical  integration in manufacturing industries usually includes joint design and joint development  functions to reduce the time spent on preparing for mass production. in this business model,  head offices have to integrate their various operation processes and inside suppliers. thus,  gains of vertical integration cannot be realized without the help of the target’s and the  acquirer’s managers. in addition to its impact on formal structure and systems of the merged  unit, organizational integration also shapes informal processes by means of creating informal   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from

1842   journal of management / november 2014 examining the diversification–performance relationship, palich, cardinal, and miller (2000)  investigate meta-analytic data from 55 previously published studies. in their regression  work, the set of correlations based on accounting performance measures are analyzed  separately from the set of correlations based on market measures. the results show that  market-based performance measures are more relevant to diversification and acquisition  research since they capture expectations of future returns, as opposed to past outcomes  reflected in accounting-based measures. the primary dependent variable in the second-stage  performance model is market value, calculated as log (price of outstanding common shares ×  number of shares + book value of preferred stock + book value of debt) (miller, 2006). the  adoption of market value is also common in finance studies on diversification, which suggests  that using market-based measures of performance allows better controls of potential  endogeneity than using accounting-based measures (mansi & reeb, 2002). acquisition integration choice. the primary dependent variable in the first-stage probit  model is the acquisition integration choice. to examine hypotheses that acquisition  performance differs based on the different levels of acquisition integration selected, i define  the variable acquisition integration choice (high) equal to one for those firms that select a  high level of postacquisition integration (firms that score above the average score on  headquarters centralization, interdivisional, integration, and acculturation), and otherwise  equal to zero for other choices. the use of acquisition integration choice (high) as a dummy  variable also matches the management studies (e.g., miller, 2006) that adopt the two-stage  technique proposed by heckman (1979). the underlying assumption of the present study is  that firms are assigned exogenous acquisition types (unrelated, vertical, or related  acquisition) and then select the level and type of acquisition integration (structure and  acculturation). unrelated, vertical, and related acquisition. i develop measures of vertical, horizontal, and  unrelated indexes in acquisitions by theory of i/o analysis. the maximal and minimal related  acquisition index values for the sample are 1.00 and 0.00, the maximal and minimal vertical  acquisition index values are 0.53 and 0.00, and maximal and minimal unrelated acquisition  index values are 0.96 and 0.00. for detailed definitions of these indexes, please see the appendix. organizational structure. two variables can be used to characterize cm-form firms:  headquarters centralization and interdivisional integration (hill et al., 1992). an organization  is regarded as cm-form when degrees of centralization and integration are both high.  according to the centralization dimension developed by ghoshal and nohria (1989: 336),  headquarters centralization in this study is measured by divisional managers estimating  the degree to which the head office influences divisional (a) introduction of new products,  (b) changes in product design, (c) changes in manufacturing processes, and (d) career  development plans for senior managers (5-point scale, cronbach’s α = .85). in the  dimension of integration, interdivisional integration, containing operational integration  and strategic integration (burgelman & doz, 2001), is measured by divisional managers  estimating the degree of interdivisional activities in (a) joint procurement, (b) sharing a sales  force, (c) sharing production information, (d) sharing best practices in various administrative   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1843 processes, and (e) involving the combination of resources from different divisions to create  new business (5-point scale, cronbach’s α = .87). acculturation. acculturation is a cultural process through which employees of the target  firm are acculturated to the acquirer’s belief, assumptions, and values (larsson & lubatkin,  2001). based on håkanson (1995) and larsson and lubatkin (2001), acculturation is  measured by the acquired firm’s managers concerning the level of (a) jointly shared  meanings fostering cooperation between joining firms, (b) a joint organizational culture  through activities such as cross-visit, celebrations, and other rituals, and (c) the existing  culture in the acquired firm being forced to change (5-point scale, cronbach’s α = .84). control variables. as diversification performance studies have suggested, four variables  (leverage, preacquisition firm profitability, r&d intensity, change in the overall market) are  used to reduce possible endogeneity biases (miller, 2006). leverage is measured as the ratio  of the book value of debt to market value, as defined in the dependent variable (mansi &  reeb, 2002). the acquirer’s preacquisition firm profitability is measured as the 3-year  average return on assets (roa) covering the past 3 years (t = –1, t = –2, and t = –3) before  the acquisition (hambrick & cannella, 1993). it is examined as industry-adjusted  profitability by subtracting industry average profitability (industry 3-year average roa).  r&d intensity is the target’s r&d expenditure over total assets in the year before the  acquisition (miller, 2006). based on the overall stock appreciation for the taiwanese market,  change in the overall market is measured as the overall market value in the postacquisition  year (t = +1) minus the overall market value in the preacquisition year (t = –1). shaver  (1998) argues that change in the overall market should be controlled in studies of acquisition  performance because it may simultaneously affect acquirers’ performance on market value,  as well as their willingness to acquire firms in industries that are growing or recessive. this study also concerns other control variables. relative size has been found to positively  affect predicting acquisition performance (datta, 1991). it is measured as the ratio of the sales of  the acquired firm to that of the acquirer in the year before acquisition. it seems reasonable to  expect a relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition capabilities (barkema &  schijven, 2008). acquisition experience is measured as the number of acquisitions completed by  the acquirer in the 10 years preceding the observed acquisition. foreign target, also controlled in  this study, is coded as 1 if the target is not from taiwan and 0 otherwise. finally, considering that  macroeconomic factors might have impact on profitability, 6-year dummy variables are created  in the sample with the omitted year 2002. these dummies are not significant in the sample,  indicating no significant difference on integration choice and performance across time periods. results first-stage acquisition integration choice estimates table 1 provides summary and correlation statistics for all variables. table 2 presents the  result from two potential acquisition integration choice models. the use of acquisition   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from

(2009) argue that too much acquisition integration is  unnecessary for acquiring technological firms. datta (1991) also indicates that relative size  is a predictor of acquisition integration because it may affect the governance choice of  resource combination in the postacquisition stage. model 2 introduces measures of related, vertical, and unrelated acquisition, which are  viewed as exogenous variables in second-stage performance model. as suggested by strategy- structure-fit studies (hill et al., 1992), a firm’s level of acquisition integration shall follow  its acquisition strategy. acquisition strategy must dominate the design of organizational  acculturation because “the strategy imposes operating requirements and, in turn, the  administrative structure must provide the climate for meeting them” (ansoff, 1965: 7).  results of model 2 also confirm the perspective that “structure follows strategy” (chandler,  1962: 297) and show that acquisition strategy determines the level of consequent organizational  integration. the positively significant coefficients of related and vertical indexes reveal that  firms undertaking related and vertical acquisition are more probable to select high levels of  acquisition integration. conversely, the negatively significant coefficient of unrelated index   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1846   journal of management / november 2014 reveals that firms undertaking unrelated acquisitions are less probable to select high levels of  acquisition integration. the inverse mills ratio from this model is introduced as a control  variable in the second-stage performance model. second-stage acquisition performance estimates tables 3 and 4 record results of second-stage regressions designed to illuminate the  relationships between acquisition strategy, acquisition integration, and performance. to  assess the problem of multicollinearity, variance inflation factors (vifs) were calculated for  each coefficient. vifs of all associated coefficients range from 1.10 to 3.49, which implies  minor multicollinearity. the durbin–watson statistics for regression models range from 2.09  to 2.65, also suggesting that autocorrelation does not bias the parameter estimates. as for year  dummy variables, i include six dummy variables for each year (except 2002) to control any  time-specific variations. since none of these variables are significant, dummy variables for  each year are not shown in the tables. in table 3, model 3 presents a baseline specification  including an intercept term, control variables, strategy and structure variables, and a dummy  variable of acquisition integration choice (high). while model 3 does not control self- selection biases, i present the results to demonstrate how the correction for self-selection  influences the coefficient of acquisition integration choice (high). the inverse mills ratio  from first-stage probit model is added as a control variable (λ) in models 4 and 5. the  coefficient for λ is significant at the α = .01 level, and its introduction removes significance  from acquisition integration choice (high). the significance of coefficient for λ also indicates  that firms have self-selected the most favorable type and level of acquisition integration. in model 5, i insert the interaction terms to assess the effects of acquisition strategy ×  organizational structure and acquisition strategy × acculturation on postacquisition performance.  the statistically significant negative interaction terms between unrelated acquisition and  headquarters centralization (p < .05) and between unrelated acquisition and interdivisional  integration (p < .05) indicate that an m-form structure is beneficial for unrelated acquisitions  to achieve high acquisition performance. hypotheses 1a and 1b are therefore supported.  moreover, the statistically significant positive interaction terms between vertical acquisition  and headquarters centralization (p < .05) and between vertical acquisition and interdivisional  integration (p < .05) indicate that a cm-form structure is beneficial for vertical acquisitions  to achieve high acquisition performance. hypotheses 2a and 2b are thus supported. the  statistically significant positive interaction terms between related acquisition and headquarters  centralization (p < .01) and between related acquisition and interdivisional integration  (p < .05) suggest a cm-form structure is beneficial for related acquisitions to achieve  high acquisition performance. these results also support hypotheses 3a and 3b. in testing  hypotheses 4 to 6, the statistically significant negative interaction terms between unrelated  acquisition and acculturation (p < .05) and the statistically significant positive interaction  terms between related acquisition and acculturation (p < .05) support hypotheses 4 and 6 but  not hypothesis 5. for carefully examining the interaction terms of each acquisition type, table 4 further  examines interactions, in which only one acquisition type is considered. when concerning   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from

lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1851 (costs). informal integration, the cooperative acculturation process to form a jointly determined  culture (larsson & lubatkin, 2001), also implicitly coordinates work by anticipating the  actions of the interdependent actors and sharing a common set of norms, values, and beliefs.  as acquisition is associated with personnel change, disrupted career prospects, loss of identity  and security, and alteration in working practice and culture, lack of understanding acculturation  has been blamed for unsatisfied acquisition performance (cartwright & cooper, 1994). if the  acculturation process is smooth, the acquired firm’s members will feel that the implementation  of an acculturation can help them adapt to the new organization. however, if two firms fail  to agree on the degree of acculturation, stress and resistance from employees will occur  (nahavandi & malekzadeh, 1988). the findings of this study suggest that unrelated acquisitions demand only low levels of  acculturation since this strategy realizes economies of internal capital markets. partners of  two sides are relatively independent, in which business in different divisions will be conducted  in a “hands-off” manner, and share a financial governance system with minimal cultural  exchange. regarding organizational structure, as different acquisitions require different  organizational structures to achieve economic benefits, this study argues that the postacquisition  organization in unrelated acquisitions should adopt an m-form structure. as for related  acquisitions, the findings suggest that the establishment of effective interdivisional integration  and a similar culture is required since economic performance is enhanced through shared  values and the utilization of joint inputs or activities. high acculturation occurs when the  acquirer’s culture is considered attractive and individual autonomy in the acquired members  is less valued. as the acquirer tends to impose its culture on the acquired firm owing to its  knowledge-based and technological advantages, the acquired managers may leave the  merged organization, for they lose their power and decision-making authority. thus, how to  reduce cultural clashes becomes important for related combinations. moreover, this study  argues that a cm-form structure is appropriate in related acquisitions because of the need of  interdivisional coordination based on the nature of reciprocal task interdependence. in vertical acquisitions, the findings support only arguments of high centralization and  high integration but not those of high acculturation. one of the reasons may be that vertical  acquisitions involve two firms in different industries but focusing on linked value chain  activities in the production process. their operations and practices are therefore different  (e.g., one focusing on manufacturing and the other on marketing). hence, managers in the  merged division need autonomy to apply their specialized knowledge into the business  domain, and the acquired firm prefers to preserve its valuable practices and routines.  therefore, high acculturation is not appropriate for the target’s employees because of their  professionalism and familiarity in the specialized value chain activities. limitations and suggestions for future research this study has limitations, which in turn provides opportunities for future research. one  limitation is the use of a short-term cross-sectional research design in this study. several  authors have used congruence models to argue that the type of fit varies in different  organizational life cycles (hill et al., 1992). therefore, managers are responsible for designing   at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


1852   journal of management / november 2014 organizations in ways that best fit environmental and strategic challenges. as long as strategy,  structure, culture, and individuals can work together to provide a highly congruent system, a  successful organization will be possible. nevertheless, the results of this study show only  short-term performance. the structure and culture that foster success in the current life cycle  may cause congruence to be a “managerial trap” (o’reilly & tushman, 2004), which  becomes a significant barrier to change. the second limitation concerns the focal industries—high-tech industries—investigated  in this study. because of the fact that all sample firms in this study are in the taiwanese  electronic and information industry, the results are informative in the electronic and information  industry and can be generalized only to acquisitions in other technological industries.  moreover, as “technology is an important component of the acquired firm’s assets” in high- tech industries (ahuja & katila, 2001: 197), firms adopting technology acquisitions tend to  pay more attention to technology interdependence (e.g., intangible technological resources and  innovative capacity of the acquired firms), instead of the nature of task interdependence or  resource interdependence. since this study does not discuss technology interdependence but  task interdependence, the results do not show significant differences between vertical and  related acquisitions. therefore, a typology concerning the interdependence of target’s and  acquirer’s technology may be worthy for future research. concerning limitations in measures, one of them is that since the measures in this article  are at the industry level, it is possible that the results cannot entirely reflect strategies or  conditions at the firm level. with regard to financial performance, while financial  performance is generally recognized as a critical indicator for firms, innovation performance  (e.g., r&d and patent intensities) is particularly important in technological acquisitions  (hitt et al., 1991). organizational designs that drive different types of performance are  therefore not the same. for example, a mechanistic organizational structure may produce  manufacturing efficiency at a low cost, whereas an organic structure enhances technological  innovation and growth. when two acquisitions are undertaken simultaneously, with one  acquisition for production efficiency and another for innovation, how shall these seemingly  inconsistent design elements be resolved? research on ambidextrous organization (gibson  & birkinshaw, 2004) does provide a possible clue to understanding how seemingly  conflicting designs can coexist in an organization and actually promote long-term success.  as both exploitation and exploration are required to achieve persistent success, an  ambidextrous organization is generated simultaneously in both tight and loose coupling and  composed of highly differentiated and loosely integrated subunits. therefore, exploratory  efforts may be configured as “structurally independent units, each having its own processes,  structures, and cultures but integrated into the existing senior management hierarchy”  (o’reilly & tushman, 2004: 76). conversely, exploitative efforts that focus on decreasing  variance as well as increasing efficiency and control may require enhanced coordination  and integration. although a culture with tight or loose elements requires recruiting new  workers to deal with its ambidexterity, the pursuit of ambidexterity is particularly important  for long-term adaptation when acquiring firms in multiple, loosely connected domains  (gibson & birkinshaw, 2004).  at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from 


lin / organizational structure and acculturation in acquisitions  1853 conclusion this study examines the relationship among strategy, organizational integration, and  performance while controlling the endogeneity of acquisition strategy type and integration  choice. conforming to the idea that “structure follows strategy” (e.g., chandler, 1962; galan  & sanchez-bueno, 2009; hill et al., 1992), the empirical results based on taiwanese  electronics and information sectors indicate (a) tighter acculturation with higher interdivisional  integration and headquarters centralization relates to superior performance in related  acquisitions, (b) looser acculturation with lower interdivisional integration and headquarters  centralization relates to superior performance in unrelated acquisitions, and (c) in vertical  acquisitions, only high degrees of interdivisional integration and headquarters centralization  facilitate superior performance. furthermore, this study contributes to the prior literature by  considering integration choice of both organization structure and acculturation process as  well as explaining the collective effects of organizational strategy, structure, and acculturation  on acquisition performance. methodologically, measures based on i/o construct help to  distinguish vertical, related, and unrelated acquisitions, allowing management scholars to  classify and investigate different strategies of firms’ diversification and acquisition. appendix i/o-based measures of acquisition strategy for an acquisition, i develop measures of vertical, related, and unrelated indexes based on the input/ output (i/o) analysis in three steps. the first step is to develop interindustry transactions table (matrix  a, 161 × 161 industries) and the inversed matrix of a (or matrix (i-a)–1) that report the source and  value-added structures for each industrial intermediate product or service and indicate the level of  input and output interdependences between industries. the second step is to estimate the interindustry  vertical, related, and unrelated indexes according to fan and goyal (2006). finally, the firm-level  measures are then applied to a large sample of acquisition cases. for the input side, each element ( aij )  in matrix a represents the money value of ith industrial output given jth industrial output constant. in  consideration of the vertical interdependence between industries i and j, there are two possible situa- tions (fan & goyal, 2006): (a) output of industry j becomes input of industry i and (b) output of  industry i becomes input of industry j. for an acquisition that the acquirer only operates in industry i,  and the acquired firm only operates in industry j, the vertical index of this acquisition is defined as   vij  = 1/2 ( vij + v ji ) (1) where 0 ≤   vij  ≤ 1, and v ji  = value of jth industry consumed by ith industry ( aij ) / annual value of ith industry v ji  = value of ith industry consumed by jth industry ( aji ) / annual value of jth industry thus, vij  measures the degree of averaged vertically interdependence between industries i and j.  for developing a related index between industries i and j, researchers should simultaneously concern  industrial substitutions from both input and output sides (fan & lang, 2000). from the output side,  each element, bij , in matrix (i-a)–1 is defined as the increased sales of industry j, given final demand  of industry i increased one unit. thus, the degree of output substitution between industries i and j can   (continued)  at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from

(4) where wp  is the sales percentage in industry p for the acquirer,   r ∑ p=1 w p   = 1 ; wq is the  sales percentage in industry q for the acquired firm,    r ∑ q=1 w q  = 1 .  related acquisition index ==  r ∑ p=1     s ∑ q=1  wp wq vpq     (5)  unrelated acquisition index = =  r ∑ p=1     s ∑ q=1  wp wq upq  (6) note 1. taiwan input/output tables are available at http://www.dgbas.gov.tw/np.asp?ctnode=2838&mp=1. appendix (continued)  at uzh hauptbibliothek / zentralbibliothek z?rich on november 3, 2016jom.sagepub.comdownloaded from
