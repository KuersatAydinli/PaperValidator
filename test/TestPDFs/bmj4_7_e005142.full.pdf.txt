their potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in human and animal tissues, appear to become progres- sively concentrated up the food chain.8 pops have docu- mented adverse effects on a diversity of biological systems, and extensive exposure can cause illness and death. they can disrupt endocrine, reproductive and immune systems, are associated with risk for cancer and, germane to this report, are linked to neurobehavioural disorders. as an exemplar, in a recent study evaluating the neurotoxic effects of pops, a spanish birth cohort demonstrated that prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl-153 is associated with worse psychomotor devel- opment, supporting the importance of understanding how pops interfere in brain development, in order to guide and develop environmental strategies to minimise the impact on brain health.9 other pops also exert effects on neuronal systems in preclinical models. neurotoxic effects of hexachlorocy- clohexane pesticides have been reported in animals after ingestion of a single dose, while prolonged expos- ure to low doses in rats resulted in signiﬁcantly altered skinner box behaviour (operant conditioning), and reduced nerve conduction velocity.10 11 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, frequently referred to as ‘dioxins’, are associated with neurodevelopmental delays and subtle neurobehavioural effects, including neonatal hypotonia.12 bisphenol a (bpa), used in the lining of food containers, is impli- cated in neuroendocrine and developmental abnormal- ities.13 neurobehavioural effects following perinatal exposure are reported in animals (monkey, rat and mouse) and humans.14 in rhesus monkey infants exposed in utero and during lactation, impaired learn- ing ability and hyperactivity were reported.12 some previous studies have investigated the relation- ship between exposure to environmental pollutants and neurobehavioural effects in humans. one study reported that solvent exposure was linked to an increased risk of anxiety and depressive disorders in adults.15 in another cohort study of 1512 participants, prenatal and early childhood tetrachloroethylene contaminated drinking water exposure was associated with an increased risk of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia.16 exposure to organophosphate pesti- cides in farmers was linked to higher levels of somatisa- tion, as well as higher blood levels of superoxide dismutase and lipid peroxidation and lowered total anti- oxidant capacity.17 this may be germane to psychiatric health due to the demonstrated role of oxidative stress in a number of psychiatric disorders.18 19 data also have linked heavy metal exposure to mood disorders. symptoms of manganese poisoning can include euphoria, apathy, hallucinations, ﬂight of ideas, compul- sivity agitation and verbosity; and symptoms of mercury poisoning can include irritability, poor concentration, memory deﬁciencies, anxiety and depression.20 21 in two selected samples with a psychotic disorder or bipolar dis- order, blood levels of cadmium and lead were found to be higher than in healthy control participants. although very limited in scope, these data point to a possible impact of these pollutants in mental health.22 23 heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic and lead are found in cigarettes, and this may be one of the multitudes of pathways whereby smoking may be detrimental to health.24 an understanding of which pollutants, if any, can affect the development of depressive symptoms is imperative given the widespread use of these pollutants and the substantial burden of disease imposed by uni- polar depression.25 the aim of this study, therefore, was to explore the associations between numerous assayed measures of pops and heavy metals and depressive symptoms in the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes). we hypothesised posi- tive relationships between pops and heavy metals and depression. methods participants this study included adults who participated in one of the three latter waves (2005–2006, 2007–2008 and 2009–2010) of the nhanes, for which data is publicly available (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). of a sample of 18 318 individuals who participated in one of the three waves and were aged over 18 years, those who did not have a valid depression screen were excluded from the analyses, resulting in a sample of 15 760. the maximum sample size for analyses including missing data on pollutants was 15 140 participants. for total sample size according to class of pollutant see table 1. measurements the outcome, depressive symptoms, was assessed using the nine-item depression module of the patient health questionnaire (phq-9). the phq-9 is based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition (dsm-iv) criteria for major depressive disorder and has been considered to be reliable and valid for use in the general population.26 to indicate the presence of signiﬁcant depressive symptoms we employed a cut-off point of 9/10.27 this is largely recog- nised as the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity.28 the exposures of interest included the following: heavy metals blood lead, cadmium and mercury were assessed in all three waves (n=16 691). whole blood lead (pb), cadmium (cd) and mercury (hg) concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry.29–31 polyfluorinated compounds levels of polyﬂuorinated compounds (pfcs) were mea- sured in subsamples drawn from each of the three waves 2 berk m, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005142. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005142 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


(n=5442). the quantitative detection of perﬂuorooctane sulfonamide (pfosa), 2-(n-methyl-perﬂuorooctanesul- fonamido) acetic acid (me-pfosa-acoh), 2-(n-ethyl- perﬂuorooctanesulfonamido) acetic acid (et-pfosa- acoh), perﬂuorobutanesulfonate (pfbus), perﬂuoro- hexanesulfonate (pfhxs), perﬂuorooctanesulfonate (pfos), perﬂuoroheptanoate (pfhpa), perﬂuorooc- tanoate (pfoa), perﬂuorononanoate (pfna), perﬂuor- odecanoate (pfdea), perﬂuoroundecanoate (pfua), and perﬂuorododecanoate in serum was performed using solid phase extraction (spe) coupled to high- performance liquid chromatography (hplc)—turbo ion spray ionisation (tis)—tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms; online spe-hplc-tis-ms/ms).29–31 environmental pesticides and phenols urinary levels of pesticides and phenols were measured in subsamples drawn from each of the three waves (n=5588). the method employed spe coupled online to hplc and ms/ms for measuring phenols and pesti- cides. with the use of isotopically labelled internal stan- dards, the sensitivity is sufﬁcient for measuring urinary levels of phenols in non-occupationally exposed partici- pants.29–31 phthalates urinary phthalates were measured in subsamples drawn from the ﬁrst two waves (n=3566). the test utilises hplc —electrospray ionisation (esi)—ms/ms (hplc-esi-ms/ ms) for the quantitative detection of the following meta- bolites: monomethyl phthalate (mmp), monoethyl phthal- ate (mep), monobutyl phthalate (mbp), mono-isobutyl phthalate (mibp), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (mcpp), monocyclohexyl phthalate (mchp), mono-(2- ethylhexyl) phthalate (mehp), monooctyl phthalate (mop), monobenzyl phthalate (mbzp), monoisononyl phthalate (mnp), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (meohp), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mehhp), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mecpp), monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (mcop) and monocarboxynonyl phthalate (mcnp). samples were then processed using enzymatic deconjugation of the glu- curonidated phthalate monoesters followed by online spe coupled with reversed hplc-esi-ms/ms.29–31 organophosphates urinary organophosphates were measured in a sub- sample drawn from the 2007–2008 wave (n=2593). urine samples were spiked with stable isotope analogues of the dialkyl phosphate (daps) metabolites and water was removed from the samples. the dried residue was dis- solved in acetonitrile and diethyl ether, and the daps were chemically derivatised to their respective chloro- propyl phosphate esters. the chloropropyl phosphate esters were concentrated, and analysed using gas chro- matography—ms/ms (gc–ms/ms).29–31 other exposures, such as demographic and socio- economic characteristics, medical conditions, relevant biological measures and other lifestyle factors were avail- able from the three mentioned waves of data collection. income was documented and divided into four categor- ies (less than us$10 000/year, us$10 000–us$25 000, us$25 000–us$45 000 and over us$45 000). the poverty index ratio (pir) is based on the number of family members and annual family income, calculated using poverty thresholds provided by the us census bureau.32 it was divided in quartiles as a further control variable. country of birth and ethnicity was documented and grouped as usa versus other and caucasian, hispanic, african-american and other, respectively. chronic medical conditions including cardiovascular and thyroid conditions, asthma, arthritis, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer were self-reported. smoking was assessed with a biomarker of smoke exposure, serum cotinine levels,33 which allow for the additional control of secondhand smoke; it was also categorised in quartiles. biological measurements com- prised creatinine, cholesterol and glucose serum levels. fish consumption was estimated at the 2005–2006 wave of data collection by food frequency questionnaire.34 we included this variable due to mercury accumulation in some ﬁsh species. statistical analysis the three continuous waves of nhanes were combined according to the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) instructions to achieve maximum stat- istical power.29–31 multivariate models were developed to identify factors associated with the presence of signiﬁ- cant depressive symptoms, incorporating potential con- founders including socioeconomic status, ethnicity, comorbid medical illnesses and relevant biological mea- surements. we conducted four different hierarchical models;

conditions and smoking exposure (model 2) and all plus biological measures (model 3). prevalence ratios (pr) for depression were calculated using binary poisson regression with robust estimation of ses.35 furthermore, spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between mercury and total ﬁsh con- sumption levels. the distribution of measured pollutants were extremely skewed, therefore the data were cate- gorised into quartiles, as in previous manuscripts based on nhanes data.36–39 results the prevalence of likely depression, adjusted for the sample design was 7.1% (5.4% in the 2005–2006 wave, 8.1% in the 2007–2008 wave and 7.7% in the 2009–2010 wave). characteristics for the whole group and those with and without depression are shown in table 2. table 3 shows associations between blood heavy metals and depression. serum cadmium was associated with a higher prevalence of depression (adjusted (adj) pr=1.48, 95% ci 1.16 to 1.90) after adjustment for con- founders. there was no association between depression and lead. mercury was associated with a lower preva- lence of depression (adj pr=0.62, 95% ci 0.50 to 0.78). frequency of ﬁsh consumption was associated with total circulating mercury (n=5500, r=0.366, p<0.001). several pfcs (table 4) were associated with a lower prevalence of depression; perﬂuorooctanoic acid (adj pr=0.63, 95% ci 0.44 to 0.89), perﬂuorohexane sulfonic acid (adj pr=0.67, 95% ci 0.49 to 0.92), perﬂuorodeca- noic acid (adj pr=0.62, 95% ci 0.45 to 0.86) and per- ﬂuorononanoic acid (adj pr=0.63, 95% ci 0.43 to 0.92). with the exception of the phenols, benzophenone-3 (adj pr=0.55, 95% ci 0.34 to 0.88), tri- closan (adj pr=0.66, 95% ci 0.47 to 0.93) and ethyl paraben (adj pr=0.76, 95% ci 0.57 to 1.00), there were no associations between the phthalates, pesticides and organophosphates and depression (tables 4–6). discussion in this study, cadmium was associated with an increased likelihood of depression. however, contrary to our hypothesis, other heavy metals and pops demonstrated either no association or negative associations with likely depression. heavy metals are very well-established neurotoxins, with extensive data on mercury, lead and other agents. they can interfere with major cellular systems at levels well below those causing classic signs of toxicity.40 41 cadmium induces neurotoxicity via multiple pathways, including interference with the blood–brain barrier, increases in oxidative stress, interference with zinc and calcium-dependent processes and metallothionein and induction of apoptosis. intriguingly, many of these path- ways are now known to be intimately involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.42 cadmium ions bind to mitochondria and can inhibit respiration and oxidative phosphorylation.40 furthermore, cadmium has been associated with synaptic malfunction through attenuation of na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake and blockage of voltage-gated ca(2+).43 it is worth mention- ing that ketamine, a n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist that, in turn, increases presynaptic glutamate release, has emerged as a new drug for depression treat- ment.44 similarly, lead impacts many pathways known to be operative in the genesis of depression, including neurogenesis and apoptosis, oxidative stress and glutathi- one, glutamate, calcium and calmodulin and neuro- transmitters such as acetylcholine.18 19 45 46 in one study examining mental health in individuals exposed via table 2 characteristics of the sample divided for the presence of significant depressive symptoms (phq9>9) no depressive symptoms depressive symptoms total sample female sex (%) 49.6 63.7 50.8 age* 46 (31–63) 46 (33–58) 46 (31–63) non-caucasian ethnicity (%) 51.8 57.3 52.2 born outside usa (%) 24.9 18.1 24.3 yearly family income over 45k (%) 44.9 23.5 43.1 cardiovascular illness (%) 9.8 17.8 10.5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (%) 6.3 17.4 7.3 cancer (%) 9.3 11 9.5 liver disease (%) 3 7.7 3.4 arthritis (%) 26.3 43.2 27.8 asthma (%) 12.9 23.3 13.8 thyroid disease (%) 9 14.9 9.5 family pir* 2.27 (1.17–4.18) 1.23 (0.73–2.27) 1.82 (0.96–3.60) cholesterol levels* 192 (166–221) 193 (166–224) 191 (165–221) creatinine levels* 0.87 (0.72–1.01) 0.80 (0.70–0.97) 0.85 (0.72–1.00) glucose levels* 92 (84–103) 93 (85–106) 92 (84–103) *continuous measures shown as median (iqr). phq-9, nine-item depression module of the patient health questionnaire; pir, poverty index ratio. 4 berk m, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005142. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005142 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


mining to heavy metals, including cadmium, zinc, lead and copper, higher total scale scores on the symptom checklist 90 (scl-90) were seen in the exposed com- pared with the control group, and ratings on somatisa- tion, obsessive–compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, psychoti- cism and other symptoms were higher in the exposed individuals.47 in a clinical study, higher levels of cadmium and lead were found in individuals with depression, and higher levels of lead in those with schizophrenia.48 lower selenium is linked to depression risk.49 contrary to expectations, mercury was inversely corre- lated with depression in our study. this ﬁnding requires replication and further exploration, as this relationship may be secondary to other factors associated with mercury consumption. it is thought that mercury con- sumption may be a proxy of seafood consumption, which may itself be the operative factor, or may be a proxy of factors such as socioeconomic status and omega 3 intake.8 50 thus, the protective effect of ﬁsh consump- tion, which has been shown to be associated with reduced depression risk, may outweigh any potential negative contribution of mercury to depression prevalence.51 that several pfcs were associated with a lower risk of depression was an unexpected ﬁnding, given many of these compounds have shown signiﬁcant neurodevelop- mental effects.52 perﬂuorooctanoic acid belongs to the family of perﬂuorinated compounds, which are used extensively in industrial and consumer applications, including food packaging, clothing, fabrics and carpets. they are ubiquitous in the environment, being found in dust and human milk. prenatal exposure is linked to developmental sequelae.53 perﬂuorooctanoic acid also alters brain proteins including camkii, gap-43 and synaptophysin that have critical roles in neuronal growth and synaptogenesis.54 prenatal exposure results in neu- robehavoural deﬁcits in adult mice, including hyperactiv- ity, altered spontaneous behaviour and impaired habituation, features found in many primary psychiatric disorders.55 these effects were shown to worsen with age. moreover, perﬂuorooctane sulfonic acid perturbs the functioning of motor neurones by altering α-tubulin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.56 it also induces table 3 prevalence ratios for upper quartile

single exposure.60 perﬂuorodecanoic acid stimulated the proliferation of glioblastoma cell growth, although the behavioural effects of this agent are unknown.58 polyﬂuoroalkyl chemicals (pfcs), which are widely used in consumer products, are associated with diverse adverse health impacts. there is a report of human neurotoxic effects of perﬂuorooctane sulfonic acid and perﬂuorooctanoic acid exposure. among 1400 pairs of pregnant women and their offspring who were randomly selected from the danish national birth cohort, there was an association between delayed gross motor develop- ment in infancy and maternal perﬂuorooctane sulfonic acid levels, although levels were not associated with delays in other developmental milestones, nor atten- tion.61 in another epidemiological study, perﬂuorooc- tane sulfonic acid, perﬂuorooctanoic acid and perﬂuorohexane sulfonic acid but not perﬂuoronona- noic acid, exposure was linked to attention deﬁcit hyper- activity in adolescents.62 there are no published reports on perﬂuoroundeca- noic acid, 2,5-dichlorophenol or o-phenyl phenol and the brain or neurotoxicicity. however, bpa is capable of altering neuronal function via multiple pathways, and developmental exposure to even low doses of bpa during development results in impairment of neurobe- havioural development and results in enduring impacts on brain structure, function and behaviour in animal studies. nanomolar doses of bpa can alter hippocampal long-term potentiation, resulting in signiﬁcant effects on memory.63 bpa exposure in animal models results in hyperactivity, as well as disturbed short-term and long- term memory with adult or prenatal exposure.64 65 this can be ameliorated by administration of n-acetyl cyst- eine.66 there are case reports of bpa exposure and neu- robehavioural abnormalities in humans, particularly excitability, lethargy and stress abstinence, associated with dietary exposure to food heated in plastics.67 in adolescent inner city children, phthalate exposure was linked to poorer social cognition, social communication and social awareness.68 bpa exposure has been puta- tively linked to schizophrenia.69 a relationship between increased hyperactivity and aggression in 2-year olds and prenatal bpa exposure has been suggested.70 for these reasons, we had hypothesised a positive relationship between these agents and depression; however, these relationships were not observed and, indeed, the inverse was observed in many instances. it is not clear why this may be the case. this study has many strengths but also some limita- tions. the strengths of this study include the quality and size of the nhanes database and the rigour of its mea- sures. however, given the vast number of potential pops, we did not have the ability to assess all agents of relevance. moreover, given the exploratory nature of this analysis and the absence of a singular a-priori target, the potential for type 1 errors should be noted. it also remains to be clariﬁed if these data represent true neurobiological effects, or are proxy markers of other operative variables. different pollutants have a tendency to cluster differently with important socioeconomic vari- ables. pesticides, for instance, are associated with a lower income.71 pfcs, which come from domestic utensils, are associated with the higher end of the income spectrum. this was nicely demonstrated in our analysis. although we attempted to control for such effects, we cannot exclude that residual confounding is ultimately respon- sible for the associations we found between pfcs and depression.72 conclusion in this large, population-based study of adults, cadmium levels were positively associated with depression; however, other investigated pops and heavy metals were either not associated or inversely associated with depression. this was in contrast to our hypotheses and the explanation for these negative ﬁndings remains uncertain. nevertheless, this study provides tantalising clues about agents and classes of agents requiring closer analysis. author affiliations 1impact strategic research centre, school of medicine, deakin university, geelong, australia 2orygen youth health research centre, centre for youth mental health, university of melbourne, parkville, victoria, australia 3barwon health and the geelong clinic, swanston centre, geelong, victoria, australia 4florey institute for neuroscience and mental health, parkville, australia 5department of psychiatry, university of melbourne, parkville, australia 6departments of psychiatry and pharmacology, university of toronto, ontario, canada 7campbell family mental health research institute, centre for addiction and mental health, toronto, ontario, canada 8department of medicine, northwest academic centre, the university of melbourne, st albans, victoria, australia 9laboratory services branch, ontario ministry of the environment, toronto, ontario, canada 10national institute for translational medicine, hospital de clinicas de porto alegre, porto alegre, brazil funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. competing interests none. ethics approval nchs research ethics review board approval. provenance and peer review not commissioned;
