timmuss}@microsoft.com    abstract  we propose a formal experimental paradigm designed to  help evaluate scrolling interaction techniques. such a method  is needed by interaction designers to quantify scrolling  performance, thereby providing a tool to evaluate and  improve upon new techniques. we systematically vary the  scrolling distance as well as the required tolerance of  scrolling. distance and tolerance are the parameters of fitts’  law, which traditionally has been applied to the evaluation  of pointing devices in tasks involving rapid, aimed  movement to visible targets. scrolling involves acquisition of  targets well beyond the edges of the screen, yet fitts’ law  models our experimental data very well.   we apply our paradigm to the ibm scrollpoint and the  intellimouse wheel. our experimental approach reveals a  crossover effect in performance versus distance, with the  wheel performing best at short distances but the scrollpoint  performing best at long distances. we also demonstrate that  the performance of the wheel can be significantly improved  using an acceleration algorithm. these results show that our  approach yields a practical and rigorous method for the  evaluation of scrolling techniques.   keywords  document navigation, scrolling, fitts’ law, c:d gain  introduction  scrolling through a document is a common task performed by  millions of computer users every day. mice with dedicated  controls for scrolling, including wheels and isometric  joysticks, are now nearly ubiquitous. but despite the market  penetration of such devices, we believe that scrolling  performance can be significantly enhanced. new techniques  continue to appear [10] and the increasing importance of  mobile devices has inspired new approaches, such as using tilt  to scroll [9]. in short, we are perhaps more in need of a sound  method to evaluate scrolling techniques than ever before, but  the literature has few empirical studies to offer. this is  especially true when compared to the literature for pointing  devices, where fitts’ law is a well known quantitative method  for evaluating, optimizing, and studying properties of pointing  devices (e.g. [4][6][13]).  the research and design communities need related techniques  for the evaluation, analysis, and refinement of scrolling  methods. the few empirical studies that do exist (e.g. [3][18])  suffer a common limitation: to our knowledge, there has never  been an analysis of scrolling techniques that systematically  varies the scrolling distance and the required precision of  scrolling. our results suggest that there can be performance  differences between scrolling techniques as a function of  distance or tolerance. hence failure to control for these  influential factors yields an incomplete view of a scrolling  technique’s overall performance, which in turn has the  potential to yield erroneous conclusions. to address this  significant limitation in the literature, we contribute an  experimental paradigm that uses fitts’ law to study scrolling.  to illustrate our approach and its significance, we analyze  several scrolling techniques. for example, previous results  suggest that the isometric joystick of the ibm scrollpoint is  faster than the scrolling wheel [18], but our approach shows  that the scrolling wheel is actually faster when scrolling  distances less than about 100 lines (see  fig. 6). hence each  device has quantifiable strengths and weaknesses. we also  show that it is possible to improve performance of the wheel  using an acceleration algorithm. when acceleration is used at  a high resolution of 1 line per wheel notch, it is better than or  equal to the scrollpoint or unmodified wheel up to about 200  lines. at 3 lines/notch, this increases to about 400 lines (the  largest distance that we tested).  related work  multi-stream input devices include mice with a wheel or  isometric joystick [18] for scrolling. zhai et al. report data  suggesting that the isometric joystick is 29% faster than a  wheel, for the task of visually scanning a web page for a  randomly placed but prominent hyperlink (“next”) in a text  document about 12 pages long. in their study, the wheel was  set to move 1 line of text per notch, which is more precise  but slower than the manufacturer’s default of 3 lines per  notch. subjects were also free to either roll the wheel, or use  a rate-control mode available on the intellimouse, so it is  unclear exactly what mixture of the control modes results in  the reported 29% difference.  we are not aware of any previous study of document  navigation that controls for possible effects of distance or  tolerance: only overall means are reported. this is a potential  problem, as shown in fig. 1, which demonstrates how a  hypothetical crossover effect by distance might change the  results of an experiment comparing two scrolling techniques.  if the average distance in the experiment is a, then the  “dashed” technique is fastest. at distance b, there is no            permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is

    fig. 1 influence of uncontrolled crossover effects on a  hypothetical experiment.   fitts’ law has been widely applied to pointing devices, but  to our knowledge it has never been applied to scrolling,  although it has yielded insight into multi-scale interfaces [8].  when the target is visible, scrolling a short distance (e.g. to  precisely place a figure) is analogous to target selection using  an area cursor, a task for which fitts’ law has been shown to  apply [12], but there is no direct evidence that shows if fitts’  law is valid for scrolling.  regarding the prediction of movement times with traditional  pointing devices, mackenzie [13] states “it is noteworthy of  the [fitts] model in general that correlations above .90  consistently emerge.” for our scrolling task, which is  certainly not a traditional pointing task, we find that fitts’  law also models our data with correlations of .90 or more for  all of the scrolling devices that we tested. this suggests that  fitts’ law may indeed be relevant to the study of scrolling  movements, although further studies are clearly warranted to  explore this issue.   several researchers have argued that the background task of  navigating a document should be assigned to the  nonpreferred hand, while the preferred hand operates the  mouse [3][8]. buxton and myers report that a two-handed  approach is about 25% faster than scrollbars for novices [3].  we are currently exploring several two-handed document  navigation techniques, including those supported by the  recent microsoft office keyboard [15], which includes a  scrolling wheel on the left side of the keyboard. we expect to  report on two-handed techniques in future work, but they are  not a focus of this paper.  scrolling interaction techniques  our experiment includes the ibm scrollpoint pro mouse  with isometric joystick (the “scrollpoint”) and the microsoft  intellimouse explorer with scrolling wheel. we chose the  scrollpoint and intellimouse wheel as they represent widely  available commercial devices which have been included in a  previous study [18].  ibm scrollpoint pro  the ibm scrollpoint pro is a recent commercial version of  the prototype implementation described by zhai et al. [18].  the device scrolls the document at a speed proportional to  the force exerted on the isometric joystick. the force sensor  used in the scrollpoint pro isometric joystick has a lower  sensing resolution than the ibm trackpoint that was used in  the original prototype, to allow cost reduction to a level  feasible for integration with a mouse. we tested the device  using the manufacturer’s default settings.  perhaps the most crucial property of the scrollpoint is the  self-centering nature of the isometric joystick. this allows it  to have an unlimited range since holding the stick  continuously scrolls the document, but as soon as the stick is  released scrolling stops. this is a potential advantage over  position-sensing scrolling mechanisms such as the wheel,  which have a limited range of movement before the user has  to release the device and stroke again. thus the “unlimited  range” should be particularly beneficial for scrolling long  distances in a document.   however, rate control devices may be less intuitive than  position-control devices such as the wheel, since a higher  order transfer function is required to translate the force into a  movement [1]. another problem with rate control devices is  that it is difficult to move to a new position, and then quickly  flip back to the previous position [1]. this can arise naturally  in scrolling movements if the user refers to a nearby section  of a document, and then quickly reverses the scrolling to  resume editing a paragraph. for short scrolling distances, this  can be easily accomplished on a position sensing device such  as the wheel by rolling a bit, and then quickly returning the  wheel to its previous position.   intellimouse scrolling wheel  the scrolling wheel on the microsoft intellimouse explorer  is similar to the wheel tested by zhai et al. [18], although it  rolls with less friction. the wheel senses 18 positions per  revolution, each felt by a tactile “notch” as one rotates the  wheel. we tested the wheel at the manufacturer’s default  setting of 3 lines per notch rather than 1 line/notch as used by  zhai et al. [18]. one line/notch is not the default setting, and  it is fatiguing and impractical to scroll hundreds of lines at  this setting, so there is little point in testing this. henceforth  we refer to the default 3 lines/notch as the “standard  wheel” configuration.   the intellimouse wheel is integrated with a button, which by  default triggers a rate scrolling mode that causes scrolling to  move increasingly faster as the user moves the mouse  further. it is known that rate control mappings for position  sensing devices can lead to degraded performance [17]. we  have experimented with alternate position-to-position  mappings that we believe may improve performance in this  mode, but this issue is not a focus of this paper. in fact, we  placed a shim under the wheel button to physically disable  the button, so that we could study performance of rolling the  wheel itself. this ensures a clean experimental result that is  not tainted by uncertainty of which method participants used  to scroll.   wheel acceleration algorithm  when rolling the wheel, users tend to exhibit two distinct  behaviors. when reading or moving short distances, users  move the wheel slowly in a controlled, line-by-line manner.  but when covering longer distances, users will often rapidly  “flick” the wheel to get there quickly. a probability  paper: smooth moves chi  changing the world, changing ourselves       66                         volume no. 4, issue no. 1


  distribution of wheel speed (measured as the arrival time  between individual notches of wheel movement) illustrates  these behaviors (fig. 2, solid curve). the sharp peak on the  left represents rapid wheel motions, while the second peak  represents slower “reading” motions.                             	 ! "  #$! !%    fig. 2 bimodal distribution of wheel movements and our  acceleration curve plotted on the same time scale.   we generated this graph from the data logs for all users of  the standard wheel in the experimental task described in this  paper. we have observed a similar distribution in data  collected from the day-to-day activity of people using the  wheel during actual work as well, so this distribution is not  an artifact of our experimental task. in fact, one can model  the observed distribution as the sum of two poisson arrival  processes (one for fast and one for slow wheel motions) with  over 97% of all variance explained (r2 =.974).  our acceleration algorithm uses this bimodal distribution to  improve performance. we apply a continuous exponential  transformation to rapid scrolling movements, but slow  scrolling movements are not accelerated (fig. 2, dotted  curve). the cutoff threshold is at ∆t=0.1 seconds, which is  just to the left of the local minima between the two “peaks”  of the probability distribution. this gives the algorithm a  slight conservative bias not to accelerate a movement which  the user may have intended as a slow, controlled motion  rather than a rapid flicking motion. the exponential  transformation has the form:  ∆y = k1(1 + k2∆t)α      (equation 1)  where ∆y is the resulting scroll gain factor, ∆t is the time  difference between subsequent wheel notches, k1 and k2 are  constants, and α is the exponent. with the parameters k1=4,  k2=8, and α = -2.5, the acceleration seems to aid  performance but also occurs gradually, allowing the user to  visually track a document without disorienting jumps. note  that fractional lines of scrolling may follow from eq. 1.  as the algorithm’s design is based on a naturally occurring  behavior pattern, users do not have to learn anything new to  benefit from this enhancement to the wheel. certainly, one of  our motivations for the present research was to quantify  performance of our algorithm and determine if it was always  beneficial or if it might possibly hinder performance in some  task conditions (e.g., it might speed up long movements at  the expense of short ones).  in this experiment, we evaluate acceleration for the wheel at  3 lines/notch (“accel w3”) and at 1 line/notch (“accel  w1”). we tested accel w3 to allow a direct comparison to  the unaccelerated standard wheel, which also uses a 3  line/notch setting. we tested accel w1 to see if acceleration  might allow the device to perform effectively for long  distance scrolling while also enabling the user to scroll in  smaller increments if desired.  our acceleration algorithm is specific to the wheel, but our  approach of studying patterns in user performance and  exploiting those patterns to design improved input mappings  is a general strategy that can be applied elsewhere. also, note  that we are not aware of any “acceleration” techniques that  might improve performance of the scrollpoint, as its  properties differ from the wheel. it may be possible to devise  future improvements, but designing a good transfer function  for force-sensing devices is known to be a challenging  problem [16].  fitts’ paradigm as a tool to study scrolling  it has been stated clearly in the literature that “we must  recognize when not to use fitts’ law. the law is a prediction  model for rapid, aimed movement” [14]. indeed by this  description it might seem unlikely that fitts’ law should be  relevant to scrolling, which often involves acquisition of  targets that are not yet visible on the screen.   a movement follows fitts’ law if the equation:  mt = a + b log2(d/w + 1)         (equation 2)  satisfactorily models observed behavior. in fitts’ law, mt is  the movement time, d is the distance of the movement, and w  is the width of the target that must be selected. the constants  a and b are regression coefficients fit to observed data for  mt. the term log2(d/w + 1) is also known as the index  of difficulty (id). in typical rapid, aimed movement studies,  it is not unusual to see fitts’ law model the mean observed  movement times with more than 85% of the variance  explained by eq. 2 [13].  however, it is important to note that this all relates to fitts’  law as a prediction model. our primary goal is not to predict  the movement time of a scrolling action; rather it is to  develop a useful evaluation tool that can quantify relative  performance differences among scrolling techniques. we  assert that fitts’ task paradigm can be used as an  experimental task whether or not fitts’ law actually does  model scrolling movements. we believe fitts’ task paradigm  provides a useful barometer to evaluate, compare, and make  design improvements to scrolling interfaces. our data  suggests eq. 2 can predict the resulting movement times, but  the application of fitts’ law to predict scrolling movement  times in general is more of a theoretical issue that will need  further exploration in future studies.  representative tasks for scrolling  when selecting a pointing device, experts recommend to  “experiment with a diverse set of representative tasks, each  [with] its own idiosyncratic demands” [2]. such  representative tasks are well known for pointing devices, but  are lacking for scrolling techniques. when we began  minneapolis, minnesota, usa • 20-25 april 2002                                                                                                             paper: smooth moves         volume no. 4, issue no. 1                         67


  evaluating different scrolling techniques, we explored a  number of experimental tasks, which reflect various user  activities involving scrolling. for example, we tried:   • scrolling while proofreading text for misspellings.   • searching for a highlighted line in a document.  • searching for a highlighted target word in a document,  in the presence of highlighted distracter words.   in pilot studies, these tasks yielded useful comments about  the techniques, even though quantitative data was not always  informative. of the tasks we explored, we felt that the fitts’  reciprocal task paradigm described below was the most  sensitive to differences between techniques, which is why we  focus on it here. however, other representative tasks should  be useful as part of an overall evaluation of a scrolling  solution, even though our emphasis in this paper is on the  rigorous quantitative results that can be obtained with our  fitts’ law experimental and task paradigm.  the experiment  reciprocal framing task for scrolling  we used a variant of fitts’ reciprocal tapping task adapted to  suit vertical scrolling movements. in fitts’ reciprocal tapping  task, subjects tap (or point at) two targets as quickly and  accurately as possible, moving back and forth between them.  in our task, subjects scrolled down, then scrolled up, moving  back and forth between two numbered lines in a document  using one of the devices (other methods of scrolling, e.g., the  scrollbar, were disallowed). a similar task should also be  suitable for horizontal scrolling, although we have not yet  tried this. we colored the initial target line red and the second  target line blue.   the “frame” at the left of the task window (see fig. 3)  specified the tolerance for the target selection, and was  colored to match the current target line (red or blue). for  each target, subjects scrolled until the target entered the range  of the screen identified by the frame. the frame was always  centered on the screen (15 lines from the top of the page),  and ranged from a tolerance of w=6 to w=30 lines. the  visible portion of the document measured exactly 30 lines, so  in the limit of w=30, a target was considered to be “in the  frame” as soon as it was visible on the screen.   once the target line was fully within the frame, the subject  hit the selection key (caps lock) with the left hand. this  selection key let the computer know when the user judged  the scrolling to be complete. we also tried using a dwell time  for selection, but this was unsatisfactory as it introduced an  arbitrary wait time that might have interfered with task  performance; it also precluded measurement of error rates. if  the target line successfully fell within the frame when the  user struck the selection key, there was a short “happy”  sound. if not, the user heard a “bad” sound, but we instructed  subjects to always continue with the next target (rather than  trying to repair the error).  fig. 3 illustrates the task. here the first target was line 97, and  the frame width was 6 lines. subjects scrolled until line 97 fell  within the frame, and then tapped the selection key1. they then  immediately scrolled to and selected the paired target line (e.g.,  line 121, yielding d=24 lines), after which they returned again  to line 97, and so on. subjects completed at least 10 individual  target acquisitions (phases) for each trial.    fig. 3 screen capture of reciprocal framing task,  showing target line (97) within the frame, w=6 lines (126  pixels).  each line of text in our document was 21 pixels (0.59 cm)  high. the visible portion of the document was 17.7 cm high  by 23.8 cm wide. for the document content, we used four  selections from public domain books, cropped at 600 lines  long. note that internet explorer (ie) moves 132 pixels per  notch for a wheel set at the default of 3 lines/notch. hence  each notch of the standard wheel corresponded to 6.29 lines  in our document. we also disabled ie’s “smooth scrolling”  feature, which animates scrolling movements2.   following the example of buxton and myers [3], we used  numbered lines to simulate scrolling in a familiar document.  this allowed subjects to find the target lines without  excessive searching, yielding a very sensitive measurement  of the manual costs of scrolling. we plan to explore the  cognitive and attentional costs of scrolling techniques as  well, but it is essential to first understand the differences  between scrolling input mechanisms in terms of the manual  costs, without introducing uncontrolled factors that might  occur in a totally unfamiliar document.  subjects  27 people (12 male) from 22-50 years of age (average 40  years) participated in the study. all subjects had normal or  corrected to normal vision with no color blindness, were  right handed, and used the mouse in the right hand. subjects  had no prior experience using a mouse-integrated wheel or                                                             1 we placed the first target at least 31 lines from the start, ensuring that it  was not visible on the first page; the time to acquire this initial target was  not part of the test.    2 this feature might add lag and thus interfere with optimal performance of  the scrollpoint or other devices (shumin zhai, personal communication).  frame target line  paper: smooth moves chi  changing the world, changing ourselves       68                         volume no. 4, issue no. 1


  scrollpoint3. to limit each session to 90 minutes, we used a  between-subjects design where most subjects tried two  devices for the task (five had enough time to use a third).  nine subjects used the scrollpoint; 12 used accel w1; nine  used accel w3; and 14 used the standard wheel. in  addition, 14 subjects used a left-handed touchpad scrolling  device [3], which we omit due to limited space.  experimental design  the design of the experiment crossed device x scrolling  distance (d) x target width (w, the tolerance). however,  these were not completely counterbalanced because certain d  and w interactions are meaningless (e.g., w=18 and d=6 is  ill-defined because both targets fall within the tolerance  without moving!). see table 1 for a listing of all distances  and widths tested. since device was not fully counter- balanced with subject (see above), we counterbalanced the  order of devices across subjects using a latin square. hence  our analysis treats device as a between subjects variable, and  subject as a random variable (we do not report interactions  with subject in our analysis, as these simply reflect the  effects of individual differences).  6 18 30 6 * 12 * 24 * * 48 * * * 96 * * * 192 * * * 384 * * * width d is ta nc e   table 1.  widths (w) and distances (d) tested in our study.  the shaded portion fully counterbalances w and d.  following a block of practice trials for each device, subjects  performed two blocks of test trials. each block consisted of a  trial for each of the 16 distance-width combinations in a  random order. thus, subjects performed 2 trials for each  distance-width combination for each device. each trial  consisted of 10 or 20 phases of reciprocal movement  between target lines; for distances of 24 or fewer lines there  were 20 movement phases, while for distances of 48 or more  lines there were only 10 phases, to limit the total time  required to complete the experiment. thus each subject  performed 2 blocks of 16 d/w combinations, 12 with 10  phases and 4 with 20 phases, for a total of 400 individual  scrolling movements per device.  procedure  participants read instructions describing the experimental set- up and task. the experimenter then reviewed these  instructions with the subjects, introduced the input devices,  and walked subjects through several practice trials. when the  experimenter was satisfied that subjects understood the task                                                             3 three subjects had used an ibm trackpoint for cursor control on a  laptop;

  for each of our scrolling devices seems low, but this may  reflect that scrolling is a difficult task, or that scrolling input  devices are in need of improvement. the y-intercepts of the  models for each device were close to zero, and again were  well within the range of traditional fitts’ law studies. hence,  in the absence of contradictory evidence, the data suggest  that fitts’ law accounts for the scrolling movement times in  our experimental task. of course, better models may exist,  and there is no guarantee that this result will extend to other  types of scrolling tasks (e.g. [18]), but it does suggest an  intriguing direction for future inquiry.                    *+!%%%$,#         	  !&!   	   fig. 8 linear regression of id against mt for each  device.  error rates and effective width  errors were possible in the study if a subject pressed the  selection key while the target was not within the frame.  overall, subjects achieved a very low error rate which was  close to the theoretically ideal error rate of 4% in fitts’ law  studies [13]. the error rates were scrollpoint, 2.2%; accel  w1, 1.3%; accel w3, 2.9%; and standard wheel, 3.7%.  we also recorded the endpoint coordinates of all scrolling  movements (both errors and non-errors). using the standard  deviation of the endpoint coordinates, one can calculate a  quantity known as the effective width, which is the target  width that would be required to statistically correct the  subject’s performance to a 4% error rate [13]. since our error  rates were low and close to the theoretical optimum of 4%,  we found that using the effective width in our analyses had  little impact. for the fitts’ law model, for example, the  correlations for the scrollpoint and accel w1 were slightly  better (r=0.98 and r=0.91 respectively), the correlation for  accel w3 was the same, and the correlation for the standard  wheel was slightly worse (r=0.90).   we are also a bit distrustful of the effective width in this  context. for example, the relatively coarse movement  increments of the standard wheel mean that for some  targets, the subject will nearly always “perfectly” center the  line within the frame, while for others it will always be off by  a few lines. it should also be noted that many researchers do  not agree with the information-theoretic justification for  using effective width [7]. hence for brevity and clarity, we  omit analyses based on the effective width.  qualitative results  most subjects preferred the scrollpoint for scrolling long  distances (“it was very fast getting through long scroll  distances”), but they “had trouble scrolling short lengths.”  however, several users commented that in practice, they  would just grab the scrollbar with the mouse to move long  distances. nine of the 10 users also made at least 1 negative  comment about the control or precision of the scrollpoint:  for example, users commented that it was “very hard to get a  good feel for scrolling at an even speed,” and that the device  was “very ineffective in targeting lines.” three users liked  the minimal movement required by the scrollpoint:  “my  hand didn’t get tired.” however, two users disliked the  joystick feel due to the difficulty in making fine selections.   the standard wheel moved predictably; as one subject put it,  “i could control the speed of travel better.” however, 7 of 14  subjects disliked the lack of precision, although a few  preferred “scrolling through large blocks of text.” six  subjects made at least 1 negative comment about fatigue or  comfort with the wheel, particularly when scrolling up.  seven subjects commented that wheel a3 made it “very easy  to scroll long distances,” whereas not even one subject with  the standard wheel made such a comment. still, 7 subjects  suggested that they preferred the scrollpoint for long  distances. like the standard wheel, most subjects noticed  the 3 lines/notch minimum movement, but with acceleration,  9 of the 10 subjects had a negative comment about the  limited precision available. thus, acceleration may have  exacerbated the perceived control problems.  all 13 subjects who tried wheel a1 had at least one positive  comment about the increased precision. however, 10 of  these subjects also had at least 1 negative comment about  scrolling long distances: “it was very tedious to scroll long  distances [and] required a lot of finger motion.”    discussion  here, we can further compare our study to that of zhai et al.  [18], but do recall that their experimental task differs from  ours. their documents averaged 237 lines long (at 21  pixels/line). the targets required an average of 143 lines of  scrolling, whereas our study averaged 109 lines. their screen  height corresponded to w=25.6 lines. in these conditions,  they found the scrollpoint to be 29% faster than the wheel at  1 line/notch. at the most similar conditions tested in our  experiment, we did not find a significant difference between  the scrollpoint and the standard wheel.   jellinek & card [11] report that increasing gain for mice does  not improve performance, but rather reduces the required  footprint of the mouse. our study, which finds a performance  advantage for a nonlinear control gain for the wheel, does not  necessarily contradict jellinek & card. in fact, jellinek &  card’s argument that increased gain reduces the required  footprint is consistent with our result. on a tiny device like  the wheel, “reducing the footprint” is equivalent to increasing  the amount of scrolling that can be achieved before the user  has to release the wheel and stroke again. this reduction in  minneapolis, minnesota, usa • 20-25 april 2002                                                                                                             paper: smooth moves         volume no. 4, issue no. 1                         71


  total reclutching time is probably the primary source of the  resulting performance advantage.   design implications  our results show that the accel w1 mapping, which has a 1  line/notch control resolution at slow speeds, performs better  overall than the standard wheel, which uses a constant 3  line/notch mapping. hence, in addition to improving  movement times in some conditions, the acceleration  function effectively enhances the control resolution of the  wheel. this enables tasks such as fine placement of figures  or tables using the wheel, while also enabling the device to  be more effective for long range scrolling movements.    for the scrolling distances tested in this experiment, no  single technique proved to be the best across all conditions.  is it possible to design a technique which is superior across  the full range of distances and widths? one strategy would be  to improve the scrollpoint so that it can handle short  movements more efficiently. it might also be possible to  modify the wheel or optimize the acceleration algorithm to  improve long distance scrolling performance, but without  harming performance for short distances.   one might also attempt to combine techniques to improve  performance. for example, is it possible to synthesize a  combination of the accel w1 and accel w3 mappings?  based on our data, an algorithm that behaved like accel w1  for distances up to about 100 lines, but like accel w3 for  longer distances, might improve overall performance. we are  experimenting with an enhanced algorithm that applies this  insight by keeping track of the total distance scrolled in a  series of wheel movements. we have not collected formal  data, but this approach seems promising.  it is known that “users tend to interact repeatedly with small  clusters of information” [5], a property known as the locality  of reference principle. this suggests that short scrolling  movements should typically occur more frequently than long  ones. however, we are not aware of any published data on  the frequency distribution of scrolling movements. our  experiment points to the need for such data, as our  performance data could then be weighted by a frequency  distribution over distance, perhaps even on a per application  or per user basis. this might be another way to optimize  overall performance of scrolling techniques.  a design challenge for document navigation is its multi-scale  nature [8]. scrolling may range from a single line up to  hundreds of pages in a long manuscript. by contrast, screen  size limits the range of traditional pointing tasks. we believe  this makes testing and controlling for a wide range of d and  w even more vital when quantifying the performance of  scrolling techniques.   conclusions and future work  understanding the scrolling problem as a whole requires  insight into a number of issues and problems. there are other  criteria that influence performance and user acceptance,  including device acquisition times, the visual diversion  required to use a graphical scroll bar, or the integration of  scrolling into compound tasks such as navigation plus target  selection with the mouse. our current experimental paradigm  does not address these issues, but it does contribute a means  to evaluate the navigational movement itself, which has  presented an unsolved problem in the literature. we believe  this provides a solid foundation for future studies that will  further examine cognitive factors, visual attention, and other  aspects of scrolling.   references  1. balakrishnan, r., baudel, t., kurtenbach, g., fitzmaurice, g.,  the rockin'mouse: integral 3d manipulation on a plane,  chi'97, 311-318.  2. buxton, w., touch, gesture, and marking, in readings in  human-computer interaction: toward the year 2000. 1995,  morgan kaufmann publishers. p. 469-482.  3. buxton, w., myers, b., a study in two-handed input, chi'86,  321-326.  4. card, s., english, w., burr, b., evaluation of mouse, rate- controlled isometric joystick, step keys, and text keys for text  selection on a crt. ergonomics, 1978. 21: p. 601-613.  5. card, s., robertson, g., york, w., the webbook and the web  forager, chi'96, 111-117.  6. douglas, s., kirkpatrick, a., mackenzie, i.s., testing pointing  device performance and user assessment with the iso 9241,  part 9 standard, chi'99, 215-222.  7. douglas, s.a., mithal, a.k., ergonomics of computer  pointing devices. 1997: springer-verlag.  8. guiard, y., baudouin-lafon, m., mottet, d., navigation as  multiscale pointing: extending fitts' model to very high  precision tasks, chi'99, 450-457.  9. harrison, b., fishkin, k., gujar, a., mochon, c., want, r.,  squeeze me, hold me, tilt me! an exploration of  manipulative user interfaces, chi'98, p. 17-24.  10. igarashi, t., hinckley, k., speed-dependent automatic  zooming for browsing large documents, uist'00, 139-148.  11. jellinek, h., card, s., powermice and user performance,  chi'90, 213-220.  12. kabbash, p., buxton, w., the "prince" technique: fitts' law  and selection using area cursors, chi'95, 273-279.  13. mackenzie, i.s., fitts' law as a research and design tool in  human-computer interaction. human-computer interaction,  1992. 7: p. 91-139.  14. mackenzie, i.s., movement time prediction in human- computer interfaces, graphics interface '92,  140-150.  15. microsoft office keyboard, http://www.microsoft.com/  hardware/keyboard/.  16. rutledge, j., selker, t., force-to-motion functions for  pointing, ifip interact '90, 701-706.  17. zhai, s., human performance evaluation of manipulation  schemes in virtual environments, ieee vrais'93, 155-161.  18. zhai, s., smith, b.a., selker, t., improving browsing  performance: a study of four input devices for scrolling and  pointing tasks, ifip interact'97, 286-292.  paper: smooth moves chi  changing the world, changing ourselves       72                         volume no. 4, issue no. 1
