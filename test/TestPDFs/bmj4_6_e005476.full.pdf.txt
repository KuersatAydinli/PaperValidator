public health beneﬁt given the low proportion of indivi- duals meeting current pa guidelines. until now, limited epidemiological evidence has been generated on the associations between light-intensity activity and health. this is partially owing to measure- ment issues; self-reported pa questionnaires are designed to capture mvpa and there are technical lim- itations in differentiating between sitting, standing and other forms of light activity when interpreting objective activity data. the most commonly used accelerometer, the actigraph, quantiﬁes time spent in different inten- sities of activity by summing time above and below speci- ﬁed count thresholds. this method works reasonably well for identifying mvpa, but is less accurate for distin- guishing between sedentary and light activity (ie, between sitting and standing).5 thus, methods that employ postural allocation may be more reliable, which have only recently become readily available. some experimental evidence is beginning to emerge in this area. for example, one study manipulated sitting time and pa over 1 day under free-living conditions. the results indicated that replacing sitting with longer periods of light activity was more beneﬁcial for meta- bolic health than 1 h of vigorous exercise despite equiva- lent daily energy expenditure in each treatment group.6 in a laboratory-controlled trial conducted over an 8 h period, interrupting sitting time every 20 min with short 2 min bouts of light-intensity or moderate-intensity walking was shown to lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels in overweight/obese adults.7 in another study, using continuously monitored capillary blood glucose, there was a 43% reduction in blood glucose excursion during an afternoon (185 min) of standing compared with sitting in desk-based workers.8 in a pilot study replacing sitting workstations with sit–stand work- stations, employees reduced sitting time by 137 min/day and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed at 3 months follow-up.9 however, the bio- logical mechanisms underlying these effects still remain unclear, although increased muscle activation during standing could be an important underlying mechanism, for example, by increasing skeletal muscle metabolism. replacing a sitting workstation with a standing worksta- tion was shown to increase daily energy expenditure,8 thus the longer term beneﬁts might also include reduc- tions in total, visceral and liver adiposity. a reduction in total and visceral adiposity is known to have a favourable impact on a range of cvd risk factors including inﬂam- matory markers, lipids and glycemic control.10 liver adi- posity is of particular interest as it has been linked to metabolic risk and worsening insulin resistance.11 several exercise training studies have demonstrated reductions in visceral adiposity in the absence of weight loss.12 however, the relationship between light pa (standing) and total, visceral and liver adiposity has yet to be investigated using precise imaging techniques. further research is needed to aid in the understand- ing of the relationships between objectively measuring sitting and standing, using an objective postural alloca- tion technique, and measures of total, visceral and liver adiposity, using precise imaging techniques. this will contribute to the small but growing body of literature that aims to inform policy and intervention on the health beneﬁts of displacing sitting with standing. aim in the present study, several contemporary methods were used, including an objective postural allocation technique in combination with mri, to aid in the under- standing of the relationships between sitting/standing and body composition. this data collection was primar- ily designed to inform a large experimental trial that will investigate the impact of displacing sitting with standing on total, visceral and liver adiposity. this pilot data will (1) inform the underlying rationale of the trial by pro- ducing evidence, if it exists, of relationships between objective measures of sitting and standing and body composition and (2) generate an effect size on which to base sample size calculations to inform the main trial. methods design, participants and sample size this cross-sectional pilot study was carried out in 12 healthy caucasian women. the sample size for this pilot was based on previous published work, which has shown that signiﬁcant differences in body composition could be readily observed in cross-sectional studies of 10 or less volunteers.13 normal weight women with desk- bound occupations were selected from a larger cohort to minimise variability in age, weight and overall anthro- pometry. a convenience sample was recruited in january 2014 from university college london. we randomly invited 12 women who met our criteria to take part in the study. all women invited agreed to take part. one week prior to data collection trained research staff met with the participants to administer the participant infor- mation sheets and explain the study protocol. measures of adiposity for each participant, a range of body composition vari- ables were attained from a single whole-body mri session lasting approximately 45 min. for the purpose of the present study, we deﬁned our main outcomes as a priori, which included body mass index (bmi), total litres of body adiposity (l), liver adiposity (%) and vis- ceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio. whole-body mri and liver adiposity (%) were obtained on a 1.5 t phillips achieva scanner (philips medical systems, best, the netherlands) as previously described.14 each par- ticipant was asked not to participate in strenuous exer- cise or drink alcohol 24 h before their scan. each participant was also requested not to eat and only to drink water from 20:00 on the evening before their scan until the scan was completed. trained research staff 2 smith l, thomas el, bell

measured participants’ height and weight from which bmi was calculated in kg/m2. free-living activity immediately after mri, an activpal accelerometer/ inclinometer device (http://www.paltechnologies.com/) was attached to the participants’ thigh mid-way between their right hip and knee and covered with waterproof tegaderm dressing. the activpal classiﬁes an individual’s free-living activity into periods spent sitting, standing and walking, which it has been validated for.15 the activpal’s inclinometer and its unique positioning on the thigh allows the device to distinguish between sitting and standing using proprietary algorithms, which previ- ous objective pa monitors have been unable to do. the device was worn all day every day (participants were instructed to wear the device during sleep and bathing) for seven full consecutive days. bespoke software pro- vided by paltech was used to categorise activity periods into sitting/lying, standing and stepping, in addition to providing average daily step count. the data are pre- sented as average daily waking time in hours per day (classiﬁed as 7:00 to 23:59) spent sitting, standing and stepping. written informed consent was obtained from all participants. analysis characteristics of the study population, average daily time spent sitting, standing and walking and the main body composition outcomes were summarised using descriptive statistics. we performed pearson correlations to examine associations between different activity cat- egories and the body composition data. for illustrative purposes, we also created a standing:sitting ratio and derived two groups based on the median split (high and low). independent t tests were performed to compare the main body composition outcomes between groups of high and low standing:sitting ratio. we extracted the partial r2 statistic from the correlation between sitting time and liver adiposity to inform a power calculation to provide a sample size for the main trial. results of the 12 women who took part, all provided valid mri and activpal data. the volunteers had a mean age of 30.9±6.1 years, a mean bmi of 22.9±3.4 and achieved an average of 9993±5146 steps a day (table 1 contains all descriptive statistics for the study sample). on average, participants spent 12.7±1.3 h a day sitting, 3.2±0.9 h a day standing, 1.8±0.8 h a day stepping and the remain- der in sleep. there were signiﬁcant correlations between average daily sitting and liver adiposity and visceral/subcutane- ous abdominal fat ratio (r=0.66 and 0.64, respectively; see online supplementary ﬁle 1 for scatter plots between sitting and body composition outcomes); standing:sitting ratio was moderately correlated with liver adiposity and visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio (r=−0.53 and −0.45); average daily step count was moderately corre- lated with liver adiposity, total adiposity and visceral/sub- cutaneous abdominal fat ratio (r=−0.45, −0.46 and −0.51, respectively; table 2). scatter plots of these asso- ciations are presented as supplementary material (see online supplementary figures s1–s4). we observed weak associations between all activity categories with bmi. figure 1 presents comparisons between groups of high and low standing:sitting ratio in relation to the main body composition outcomes. a higher ratio of standing: sitting was consistently associated with lower levels of adi- posity. since the observed associations with sitting may have been inﬂuenced by vigorous exercise, we per- formed sensitivity analyses that removed two participants recording over 15 000 steps (indicative of vigorous exer- cise). in these analyses (n=10), the associations between sitting and adiposity remained largely unchanged; average daily sitting remained associated with liver adi- posity (r=0.65, p=0.043) and visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio (r=0.73, p=0.017). power calculation a power calculation was carried out in g-power to provide a sample size for the main trial. the calculation table 1 descriptive statistics of study sample variable mean/sd range age 30.9±6.1 24–45 bmi (kg/m2) 22.9±3.4 18.1–28.1 total body adipose tissue (l) 24.1±9.9 13.2–44.4 liver adiposity (%) 0.52±0.73 0.12–2.56 visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio 0.25±0.09 0.13–0.38 average sitting time (h/day) 12.7±1.3 11.0–15.0 average standing time (h/day) 3.2±0.9 1.4–4.4 average stepping (h/day) 1.8±0.8 0.6–3.1 average daily step count 9993±5146 2918–19 995 average daily energy expenditure (met-h) 24.4±2.3 22.6–30.2 n=12. bmi, body mass index. table 2 correlations between activpal and mri measures bmi total adiposity liver fat visceral/ subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio sitting −0.09 0.10 0.66* 0.64* stand:sit ratio 0.24 0.08 −0.53† −0.45 average step count −0.22 −0.46 −0.45 −0.51† n=12;

was based on the correlation between sitting time and liver fat: per 1 h/day sitting was associated with 0.48 (se 0.17) unit increase in liver fat (partial r2=0.43). in g-power this equates to an effect size f2=0.75, and sug- gests that a sample size of 20 per group would provide us with 95% power at 5% signiﬁcance level (two-tailed) to detect differences. discussion the aim of the present study was to investigate the asso- ciation between objectively measured sitting and stand- ing, using a postural allocation technique (an accelerometer/inclinometer attached to the partici- pant’s thigh mid-way between the hip and the knee), with mri-assessed body composition. average daily sitting time was associated with liver adiposity and vis- ceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio. previous studies have attempted to investigate these associations, but without the beneﬁt of the existing gold standard techni- ques for body composition or full postural allocation measurements. in a recent study using ct, self-reported leisure-time sitting was associated with pericardial fat, but not with any other fat depots.16 we have previously reported associations between objectively assessed seden- tary time (actigraph) and pericardial fat although the relationship did not persist after adjusting for mvpa.17 numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between sedentary time and bmi in adults and found mixed results. for example, one study carried out in a sample of 881 adults residing in australia found no signiﬁcant relationship between change in participant-reported tv viewing time and change in bmi, although a cross-sectional association was found between tv viewing time and bmi at base- line, in women only.18 in another study carried out in a sample of 3127 adults residing in southern france, participant-reported tv viewing time was associated with bmi in both sexes.19 in the whitehall ii prospective study, bmi predicted sitting time at follow-up but the converse was not found.20 conﬂicting ﬁndings may be partially explained by the fact that bmi is a poor indica- tor of adiposity. moreover, participants may not be able to recall tv viewing time accurately and tv viewing time may be a poor indicator of total sitting. in comparison to previous research the present study used precise objective measures of sitting time and body composition. interestingly, a higher ratio of standing: sitting was associated with lower levels of total and liver adiposity and visceral/subcutaneous fat ratio, providing preliminary cross-sectional evidence of the potential inﬂuence of light pa (standing) on body composition. these ﬁndings, although using a more proximal outcome, support previous literature that has found self- reported standing time is inversely related to cvd mor- tality in adults.21 the present pilot study found weak associations between all activity categories and bmi. bmi is a poor measure of adiposity in comparison to mri since it cannot distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat depots. since visceral and ectopic fat are thought to be more detrimental to health than subcutaneous,10 11 it is important to distinguish between different types of fat. furthermore, the numerator in the bmi calculation ‘total body weight’ does not distinguish between lean and fat mass. therefore, an individual with high levels of lean mass may be classiﬁed as having a high bmi; whereas an individual who is of normal weight but has excess body fat may be classiﬁed as having a normal bmi. this might partly explain why several exercise training studies have demonstrated reductions in visceral adiposity in the absence of weight loss.12 the data collection protocol and tools used within this small pilot study are feasible and can be implemented into the subsequent experimental trial; a 100% response rate was achieved and no participant dropped out of the study. moreover, all participants provided a full activpal dataset (seven complete days) and adhered to the wear protocol. however, it should be noted that the subse- quent experimental trial will require two identical data figure 1 (a) body mass index; (b), total adipose fat (l); (c) liver fat (%); (d) visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio; n=12. the high:low cut point was ≥0.27. 4 smith l, thomas el, bell jd, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005476. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005476 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


collection sessions to assess the impact of displacing sitting with standing on body composition. it was not feasible to make multiple statistical adjust- ments in our analyses owing to the small sample size, thus associations between sitting and adiposity may have been confounded by vigorous exercise. however, we selected a homogeneous sample and the removal of two highly active participants in our sample did not change the results. given the cross-sectional nature of this pilot study the direction of the observed associations remains unknown. moreover, the representativeness of the ﬁnd- ings is limited owing to the small sample size of healthy caucasian women residing in london. however, the aim of this pilot study was to provide novel data to support the underlying rationale and generate a sample size for a subsequent experimental trial. inclusion criteria for the experimental trial, that this pilot study was carried out to inform, will be over- weight/obesity. we will use a number of biomedical out- comes in the main trial including body composition (mri), and biochemical risk markers (lipids, inﬂamma- tory markers, glucose). conclusion this pilot study has provided preliminary evidence of the strong relationships between objectively measured sitting and standing (an accelerometer/inclinometer attached to the participant’s thigh mid-way between the hip and the knee) and precise measures of body composition. contributors ls and mh designed the study. all authors contributed to development of the study protocol. ls and mh drafted the manuscript. elt and jdb assisted in drafting the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. competing interests ls is supported by the national institute for health research’s school for public health research. mh is supported by the british heart foundation (re/10/005/28296). patient consent obtained. ethics approval hammersmith research ethics committee (ref nos: 07/ q0411/19 and 06/q0411/173). provenance and peer review not commissioned;
