 2 abstract     background: urinary tract infections (uti) are common among the oldest old and may  lead to a few days of illness, delirium or even to death. we studied the incidence and predictive  factors of uti among the oldest old in the general population.  methods: the leiden 85-plus study is a population-based prospective follow-up study of 86  year old subjects in leiden, the netherlands. information on the diagnosis of uti was obtained  annually during 4 years of follow-up from the medical records and interviews of treating  physicians. 157 men and 322 women aged 86 years participated in the study. possible predictive  factors were collected at baseline, including history of uti between the age of 85 and 86 years,  aspects of functioning (cognitive impairment [mmse<19], presence of depressive symptoms  [gds>4], disability in activities of daily living [adl]), and co-morbidities.   results: the incidence of uti from age 86 through 90 years was 11.2 (95% ci 9.4–13.1) per  100 person-years at risk. multivariate analysis showed that history of uti between the age of 85  and 86 years (hr 3.4 [95%ci 2.4-5.0]), impaired cognitive function (hr 1.9 [95%ci 1.3-2.9]),  disability in daily living (hr 1.7 [95%ci 1.1-2.5]) and urine incontinence (hr 1.5 [95%ci 1.0- 2.1]) were independent predictors of an increased incidence of uti from age 86 onwards.   conclusions: within the oldest old, a history of uti between the age of 85 and 86 years,  cognitive impairment, adl disability and urine incontinence are independent predictors of  developing uti. these predictive factors could be used to target preventive measures to the  oldest old at high risk of uti.

 4 urinary tract infections (utis) are common in the very elderly and account for nearly 25% of all  infections [1,2]. the incidence of uti increases with age in both men and women [3-5], and  increases from 12-29 per 100 person-years at risk in community-dwelling elderly populations  [5,6] to 44-58 per 100 residents per year at risk in long term care facilities [7,8]. these uti are  often complicated, involving the presence of structural or functional abnormalities of the  genitourinary tract [9]. especially in vulnerable older persons living in long term care facilities,  utis more often have serious consequences such as delirium, dehydration, urosepsis,  hospitalisation, or even death [10,11].    several strategies to prevent uti have been developed, such as treatment of those at high risk  with low-dose, long-term antibiotics [12,13], oestrogens [14] and cranberry products [12,15].  these strategies have been shown to be effective in preventing uti in younger women with  recurrent uti [13-15], but not yet in vulnerable older people. preventive strategies are best  applied to those at risk; however, factors associated with uti in ambulatory older patients in the  community setting have not been described.    previous studies have shown that increasing age [4,16], diabetes mellitus [17,18], stroke [19],  urine incontinence [1,20,21], prior history of uti [1,20], urogenital surgery [1,20], and impaired  functional and cognitive status [16,20] predict the development of uti among older individuals.  however, these studies investigated predictors of uti in specific patient groups, such as  hospitalised patients and patients residing in long-term care facilities and did not include older  individuals in the general population. in addition, these studies used different methods to identify  uti. it is generally accepted that diagnosing symptomatic uti in older persons is complicated 


 5 due to factors like difficult doctor-patient communication, chronical genito-urinary symptoms,  and a high frequency of positive urine cultures due to bacteriuria without complaints [22].     to target preventive strategies against utis in older individuals, those with highest risk to  develop uti have to be identified. the purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and  predictive factors of uti among the oldest old in the general population. 


 6 materials and methods  setting and study population  the leiden 85-plus study is an observational population-based prospective study of 85-year old  inhabitants of leiden, the netherlands. between september 1997 and september 1999, all  inhabitants of leiden who reached the age of 85 years were invited to participate in the study.  there were no selection criteria concerning health or demographic characteristics. the medical  ethics committee of the leiden university medical center approved the study. all participants  gave informed consent for the whole study including the use of data from their medical records  for additional analysis, following explanation of the study requirements and assurance of  confidentiality and anonymity. for participants with severe cognitive impairment, a guardian  gave informed consent.    the present study was conducted within the framework of the leiden 85-plus study. we started  follow-up for 4 years at age 86 years to allow us to study ‘history of uti between the age of 85  and 86 years’ as a possible predictor. in this study, 479 participants aged 86 years were included.  participants were revisited annually until the age of 90 years. all participants were visited at their  place of residence where face-to-face interviews were conducted, cognitive testing was  performed, information on socio-demographic characteristics and disabilities in daily living was  obtained, and a venous blood sample was taken.    urinary tract infection 


 7 the endpoint of this study was the development of the first uti from age 86 through 90 years.  this endpoint was considered present when treating physicians diagnosed uti based on signs  and symptoms and urine analysis.   the endpoint was also reached when a participant during follow-up died from uti. general  practitioners and elderly care physicians were interviewed annually to gather clinical information.  each year data were gathered about the development of clinical diagnosed uti during the  preceding year from clinician interviews and records. mortality data were obtained from the  municipality. specific data on causes of death were obtained from statistics netherlands,  according to the international classification of diseases and related disorders, 10th revision  (icd-10), including uti (icd-10 code n39.0) [23].     selection of potentially predictive factors  through an extensive search of scientific literature factors that are potentially predictive for uti  in older individuals were identified and selected for the study, within the domains socio- demographic factors, functioning, co-morbidities and renal functioning.      socio-demographic factors: during baseline interviews, a research nurse collected information  about the participants’ residency, income, level of education, body mass index and smoking  habits.    functioning: to assess cognitive function, the mini-mental state examination (mmse) was  administered. severe cognitive impairment was defined as a mmse score below 19 points  [24,25].  the geriatric depression scale-15 (gds-15) was performed to determine the presence 


 8 of depressive symptoms. the presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a gds-15 score  above 4 points. the gds-15 could only be administered in participants with an mmse score  above 19 points [26,27]. disability in basic activities of daily living (adl) was determined using  the groningen activity restriction scale (gars) [28] and defined as being unable to do any one  of the following nine adl independently: walk inside, get out of bed, get into and out of a chair,  use the toilet, wash hands and face, wash body, dress and undress, eat and drink, and make  breakfast [29]. the gars-items were dichotomized. participants were grouped into those who  had no difficulty with gars-items (score 1) and those who had difficulty or were unable to  perform the gars-items independently (score 2, 3 and 4). the total gars score was calculated  by adding the total scores of the nine items of the gars and than dichotomized into score 9  (independently) and scores > 9 (difficulty or unable to perform independependly). all  questionnaires were validated in dutch.      co-morbidities information on participants’ medical history was obtained by standardised  interviews with their treating general practitioner or elderly care physician and by examination of  pharmacy records. we obtained clinical information on the presence of diabetes mellitus, stroke  and cancer as well as information on unintentional loss of faeces and/or urine. diagnosis of  incontinence was ascertained by the general practitioner or elderly care physician. for males,  complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia  (bph) were measured with the international prostate symptom score (ipss). the ipss is an  eight question written screening tool to rapidly diagnose bph, track the symptoms of bph and  suggest management of the symptoms of bph [30]. the severity of urine incontinence was  obtained by the prafab-questionnaire, which combines objective and subjective aspects of the 


 9 severity of urinary incontinence [31-33]. prafab stands for protection (the use of pads),  amount of urine loss, frequency of urine loss, adjustment of behaviour due to symptoms, and  body (or self) image as a result of the stress urine loss symptoms.    serum creatinine concentration was measured automatically according to the jaffe method  (hitachi 747; hitachi, tokyo, japan). creatinine clearance was calculated from serum creatinine  concentration and body weight, using the cockcroft-gault formula [34]. low creatinine clearance  was defined as a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. for unknown disease, we measured c- reactive protein (crp) levels with a fully automated hitachi 911 analysis system. crp levels  above 5 mg/l were considered elevated crp levels [35].     data analyses  the incidence of uti from age 86 years onwards was calculated during 4 years of follow-up  (until age 90 years), using the life-table method. the number of first time uti was assigned to  the numerator and the observed person-years at risk were assigned to the denominator. the  observed person-years at risk were counted from age 86 to the censor date (age 90 years), to date  of death, or to date of first uti.      the association between predictive factors and the occurrence of uti in participants from age 86  years onwards was investigated with cox proportional hazards models. those factors predicting  uti in the univariate cox regression analysis with p -value <0.10 were included in a multivariate  cox regression analysis. since the gds-15 could only be administered to participants without  cognitive impairment (mmse ≥ 19 points, n=393), the variable ‘depressive symptoms’ was not 


 10 included in the multivariate analysis. the relative contribution of the different predictive factors  to the occurrence of uti was determined by calculating the population attributable risk (par),  which combines the relative risk and the prevalence of the different predictive factors. data  analyses were performed using spss for windows, version 16.0. 


 11 results  study population  between september 1997 and september 1999, 705 participants were eligible for participation in  the leiden 85-plus study. ninety-two participants refused to participate and 14 participants died  before enrolment, resulting in a study population of 599 participants (response rate of 87%) [36].  for the present study, 72 participants for whom valid clinical information about uti at age 86  was missing were excluded. 48 participants died before the age of 86, resulting in a study  population of 479 persons (response rate of 80.0% of the study population).    table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population at age 86 years (n=479). two  thirds of the population was female and 22% of the participants were institutionalised in long- term care facilities. restriction in adl was registered in more than 59% of the participants and  19% had an mmse-score below 19 points. 44% of the participants reported urine incontinence  and in almost 20% of the participants incontinence was diagnosed by the general practitioner or  elderly care physician. 15% of the participants had a history of uti between the age of 85 and 86  years. additional analysis showed that 8.3% of men and 18.3% of women had a history of uti  between the ages of 85 and 86 years (chi-square 8.3; df=1; p=0.004).     incidence of urinary tract infections  in four years of follow-up we observed 140 first episodes of uti during 1246 person-years (py)  at risk. the overall incidence of uti was 11.2 (95% ci 9.4, 13.1) per 100 py at risk. 92  participants had recurrent uti (15.6% of the total population and 47.4% of the participants with  utis). on average 6.5 % (per year range 5.7, 7.3) of all participants experienced two or more 


 12 utis per year during follow-up, of which 45.6% (per year range 40.0, 54.7) had more than one  infection per year.  246 participants died during follow-up, of whom 7 participants died from uti  according tot cbs data. the incidence of uti was 12.8 (95%ci 10.4, 15.2) per 100 py at risk for  women and 7.8 (95%ci 5.1, 10.6) per 100 py at risk for men. women had a 1.7 fold increased  risk of developing uti compared to men (hr 1.7 [95%ci 1.1, 2.5]; p=0.012).     predictive factors of urinary tract infections  table 1 shows the incidences of uti in various groups for the studied predictive factors with  their corresponding hazard ratios (hrs). the occurrence of uti was univariately associated with  (listed highest to lowest hr) history of uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years, unintentional  loss of faeces, severe cognitive impairment (mmse < 19), institutionalisation, disability in daily  living, self-reported urine incontinence, stroke, gender, education and medical diagnosis of  incontinence. utis were not associated with income, smoking, body mass index ≥27, depressive  symptoms, diabetes mellitus, bph, cancer, severity of urine incontinence, pad use, creatinine  clearance <30 ml/min and c-reactive protein >5 mg/l.   additional  analysis showed that all single items of the gars (walk inside, get out of bed, get  into and out of a chair, use the toilet, wash hands and face, wash body, dress and undress, eat and  drink, and make breakfast) predicted the risk in developing uti (table 2).    after multivariate analysis, severe cognitive impairment (mmse <19), disability in daily living,  uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years and self-reported urine incontinence remained  independently and significantly predictive for the occurrence of uti (table 3).    


 13 in both women and men, a uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years was predictive for  developing uti from age 86 onwards (in women hr 3.8 [95%ci 2.5, 5.6]; p <0.001 and in men  hr 4.4 [95%ci 1.8, 10.8]; p =0.001). further stratified analysis showed that severe cognitive  impairment (mmse <19) was associated with a three times higher risk in developing uti in  women (hr 3.0 [95%ci 2.0, 4.5]; p <0.001), but not in men (hr 1.5 [95%ci 0.6, 3.9]; p =0.41).  moreover, stroke showed significantly higher risk for developing uti in women (hr 2.0 [95%ci  1.2, 3.4]; p = 0.005), but not in men (hr 1.6 [95%ci 0.6, 4.2]; p = 0.346). also higher risk was  found for crp > 5 mg/l in women (hr 1.5 [95%ci 1.0, 2.2]; p = 0.049), but not in men (hr 0.8  [95%ci 0.4, 1.8]; p = 0.633). stratification for living situation (independently or long-term care  facility) shows no differences in predictive factors for uti (table 4).      participants with uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years had an increased risk of developing  uti during follow-up compared to participants without an episode of uti between the ages of 85  and 86 years (figure 1 and table 1; hr 4.1 [95%ci 2.9, 5.9]). the risk of a recurrent uti was  greatest within the first year of follow-up (hr: 6.8 [95%ci 4.1, 11.1], hr 2nd to 4th year: 1.8  [95%ci 0.9, 3.6]).     additional analysis showed that among participants without an uti between the ages of 85 and  86 years, female gender and stroke were predictors of developing uti (hr 1.5 [(95%ci 1.0,  2.4]); p = 0.059 for gender and hr 2.0 [95%ci 1.2, 3.2]; p =0.011 for stroke, respectively). no  further differences in hazard ratios were observed for the other potentially predictive factors  between participants who had had a uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years and participants  who had not had an uti.  


 14 population attributable risk  table 3 presents the relative contribution of the various predictive factors to the occurrence of  uti from age 86 years onwards, expressed by the population attributable risk (par) of each  variable that was shown to be predictive of uti in the multivariate analysis. the highest pars  for the development of uti were found for disability in daily living (44%), self-reported  incontinence (33%), history of uti between the age of 85 and 86 years (24%) and severe  cognitive impairment (20%). after multivariate analysis gender, institutionalisation, education,  stroke, unintentional loss of faeces and medical diagnosis urine incontinence were not predictive  any more for uti.  


 15 discussion    in this population-based prospective follow-up study among the oldest old, the incidence of uti  was 11.2 per 100 person years at risk. severe cognitive impairment, disability in daily living,  history of uti between the age of 85 and 86 years and self-reported urine incontinence were  among the strongest predictors for developing uti from age 86 years onwards. the population  attributable risk was highest for disability in daily living (44%).     as in other studies, we found females to have a greater risk of developing uti than men.  however, in the multivariate analysis gender was no longer a predictor of uti. possibly, in old  age, other predictors play a greater role in predicting uti than gender per se. in spite of the  differences between older persons living independently and older persons living in long-term care  facilities; we found the same predictive factors for uti from the age 86 years onwards in both  populations.      it is well known that patients with a history of uti have a higher rate of uti than those without a  history of uti [1,20]. in our study a history of uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years was a  strong predictor of recurrent uti from the age of 86 years onwards. besides a history of uti  between the age of 85 and 86 years, our study showed that disability in daily living and severe  cognitive impairment, both factors reflecting declined functional status, were also predictors of  uti. these findings are in line with other studies [16,19,20]. since 19% of our population-based  sample was severely cognitively impaired and almost 60% had disability in daily activities, 


 16 declined functional status greatly contributes to the occurrence of uti in the general oldest old  population.   although diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with greater predisposition to uti in  other study populations [17,18,37-39], we did not find any association between diabetes mellitus  and uti in our study population. perhaps differences in age, type of diabetes and definition of  uti explain these contradictory findings. on the other hand, previous studies showed that  diabetes was no longer associated with cognitive decline and the incidence of lower respiratory  tract infections at old age, indicating that the clinical impact of diabetes is possibly diminished in  old age [40,41].    the present study is a unique population-based sample of participants aged 86 years and over,  with extensive baseline measurement and almost complete follow-up for morbidity and mortality.  to our knowledge, we are the first to examine the incidence and predictive factors of uti in a  large group of unselected very old individuals in a population-based setting. it is important to  study predictive factors of uti in old age specifically, because they are the fastest growing part  of the general population and the incidence of uti increases with age [3-5]. the fact that we only  studied 86-year-olds could also be considered a limitation of our study. since bladder structure  and function, and the immune system have been shown to change with age [3], our results may  not be generalized to younger elderly. another limitation of our study might be that utis were  diagnosed during clinical practice, not diagnosed by standardised diagnostic studyprocedures. in  our study, however, all utis were diagnosed by general practitioners and elderly care physicians  based on signs and symptoms and urine analysis. this procedure reflects usual care and enables  generalisation of our results to daily care for the oldest old. 


 17 it is generally known that symptomatic uti is over-diagnosed in elderly populations given the  high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria [5], especially in long-term care facilities with a  prevalence of 25-50% [22]. also difficulties in communication, chronic genitourinary symptoms,  and the high frequency of positive urine cultures, make ascertainment of symptomatic uti  problematic for the functionally impaired elderly [22]. also urine cultures are often contaminated  and the lack of existence of specific markers of infectious bladder inflammation makes it difficult  to diagnose uti in impaired elderly.  in our study, we found an uti incidence of 11.2 per 100  person years at risk for persons aged 86 years and over. this may be an overestimation due to the  presence of bacteriuria. however, the incidence found in this study is comparable with data from  the dutch national gp registration (11.7 for men and 29.4 for women aged 85 years and over) [4]  and the fact participants actively visited their treating physician with uti like symptoms.     further, it is known that long-term catheterization is a strong risk factor for uti and bacteriuria  in institutionalized older persons [10]. unfortunately, we did not have any information about  long-term catheterization in our study population and could not report on the predicting effect.  these is a limitation of our study, but we believe that this may not have affected the results of our  study much, since in dutch nursing homes there is a policy to avoid the use of catheters in situ  and it has been so for many years [42].    in older populations, utis account for nearly 25% of all infections [1,2]. as utis are associated  with serious negative outcomes, it is important to consider preventive strategies for uti in older  individuals. our study showed four important predictors for uti, severe cognitive impairment,  disability in adl, history of uti between the ages of 85 and 86 years, and self-reported urine 


 18 incontinence. remarkably, none of these predictors appear to be modifiable. however, these  predictors could still be used in the development of a clinical prediction rule to select for whom   apply preventive strategies. prophylaxis with low-dose, long-term antibiotics [12,13], estrogens  [14] and cranberry products [12,15] are potential strategies to prevent uti, but so far none of  these strategies have been proven to prevent uti in the very old. selection of high risk oldest old  is a crucial first step in successful prevention of uti. before these preventive strategies may be  introduced in the oldest old, their effects and side effects have to be studied in randomised  intervention studies.
