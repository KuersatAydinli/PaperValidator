integrating text with video and 3d graphics: the effects  of text drawing styles on text readability  jacek jankowski, krystian samp, izabela irzynska, marek jozwowicz, stefan decker  digital enterprise research institute, national university of ireland, galway, ireland  firstname.lastname@deri.org        figure 1. left: recomended text drawing styles: white and black billboards; right: questionaire for measuring subjective views.   abstract  there have been many studies of computer based text  reading. however, only a few have considered text  integrated with video and 3d graphics. this paper presents  an investigation into the effects of varying (a) text drawing  style (plain, billboard, anti-interference, shadow), (b)  image polarity (positive and negative), and (c) background  style (video and 3d) on text readability. reading speed and  accuracy were measured and subjective views of  participants recorded.   results showed that: (a) there was little difference in  reading performance for the video and 3d backgrounds; (b)  the negative presentation outperformed the positive  presentation; (c) the billboard drawing styles supported the  best performance; subjective comments showed a  preference for the billboard style. we therefore suggest, for  reading tasks, that designers of interfaces for games, video,  and augmented reality provide billboard style to maximize  readability for the widest range of applications.  author keywords  readability, legibility, text drawing styles, image  polarity, augmented reality, 3d graphics, aesthetics.  acm classification keywords  h.5.2. information interfaces and presentation (e.g., hci):  user interfaces – screen design. i.7.2. document and text  processing: document preparation – multi/mixed media.  general terms  design, experimentation, human factors.  introduction  reading is our essential function. we all read for pleasure,  and we read to explore and understand the world.  increasingly, reading is taking place on the computer screen  and less so on the paper. computers and the web in  particular, have affected reading in many ways: they make  information more accessible; they enable readers to interact  with text in new ways.  reading text is the main form of reading. however, the text  we usually read is surrounded by illustrations, photos, and  other kinds of media. we read it all. thanks to the fast  increase in the performance of affordable graphics  hardware, textual information can be finally augmented  with three-dimensional visualizations.  expressing information through 3d visualization is already  bringing huge benefits for a variety of applications ranging  from video games (e.g., world of warcraft) through virtual  realities (e.g., second life) to serious applications (e.g.,  engineering or medical visualizations, cultural heritage  preservation). in majority of these applications, 3d  representation is accompanied by textual information to  effectively and comprehensively convey the information.  however, little work has been done to research how best to  display 3d graphics together with textual information.  the practice of reading is changing and as technology  continues to advance we can expect new forms of reading  to emerge [4,20]. augmented reality (ar), the class of  technologies that overlay data on top a user's view of the  real world, has been a very popular trend this year. first    permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. to copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee.  chi 2010, april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, georgia, usa.  copyright 2010 acm  978-1-60558-929-9/10/04....$10.00.    chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1321


  mobile ar applications (e.g., wikitude1 world browser for  android platform) appeared on the market and they are  getting a lot of attention. as personal digital assistants  (pdas) and smart-phones are becoming more powerful and  more affordable we believe that presenting users with data  about their surroundings, nearby landmarks, and other  points of interest by overlaying information on the real-time  camera view will become mainstream in the near future.  such augmenting information will consist mostly of textual  data. therefore, we need to create clear guidelines on how  best to display readable text on top of a video background.  in this article we are exploring the effects of different  techniques of integrating text with video and animated 3d  graphics on text readability. namely, we present an  investigation into the effects of varying:   • text drawing styles: (a) “plain/standard” text, (b)  “billboard” (text rendered on a semi-transparent panel),  (c) text with “anti-interference” (ai) font enhancement  [12], and (d) text with shadow;  • image polarity: (a) positive (dark characters appear on a  light background, e.g., black on white) and (b) negative  (light characters appear on a dark background, e.g., white  on black);  • background: (a) compilation of short videos taken in the  city and nature environments and (b) compilation of short  videos recorded in world of warcraft game;  on readability of text. figure 1 shows some of the examples  of the techniques we evaluated in our experiment.  the rest of our paper is organized as follows: section 2  discusses related work. we describe formative evaluation in  section 3. in section 4 we present user study that has been  designed to explore readability issues involved when  integrating video and animated 3d graphics with textual  information. the results from the experiment are then  presented and discussed. section 5 draws conclusions and  gives an outlook to future work.   related work  in this section we survey the work that has been done in the  area of integrating textual information with video and with  three-dimensional graphics.   integration of text with 3d presentation  annotation techniques for 3d illustrations and virtual  environments can be divided into two categories [5, 19]:  • object-space techniques: annotations are embedded into a  3d scene (e.g., placing information onto object surfaces  or using billboards).   • screen-space (viewport-space) techniques: annotations  are placed on a 2d plane that overlays a 3d scene. such  techniques ensure better legibility of text.                                                             1 http://www.wikitude.org/   in this article we are interested in later techniques; below  we describe them in more detail (more information about  object-space techniques can be found in [5,16,19]).   annotating 3d illustrations  a first approach for the annotating/labeling of illustrations  of 3d objects is presented in [22] by preim et al. their  system, zoom illustrator, reserves part of a view plane for  textual descriptions connected by lines to the referenced  objects. ritter et al. use shadow of 3d objects for both  emphasizing scene objects and as a reference for  annotations [23]. in [27], sonnet et al. introduce expanding  annotations, the methodology to present text information  adjacent to associated scene objects. the scrollable  annotations expand smoothly on demand and are rendered  as 2d semi-transparent polygons in screen space (figure 2).      figure 2. expanding annotations (from [27]).  in [28], sonnet et al. conducted a study in which they have  compared methods of associating text with its 3d model;  they evaluated the effects of text positioning, connectivity,  and visual hints on comprehension under three different  conditions: (a) annotations are directly attached to scene  objects using translucent polygonal shapes; (b) annotations  are located within the objects’ shadows in the scene; (c)  area showing the 3d model and text area are separated.     figure 3.  the conditions for evaluation used in [28].  the authors suggest that technique in setting a works well  for short labels, while for extensive texts, setting c seems to  be applicable because a user can explore a scene without  any occlusions from the text.  in [14], we presented 2-layer interface paradigm (2lip),  an approach for designing simple yet interactive 3d web  applications. it is an attempt to marry advantages of 3d  experience with the advantages of the narrative structure of  hypertext. the hypertext information, together with  graphics, and multimedia, is presented semi-transparently  on the foreground layer. it overlays the 3d representation of  the information displayed in the background of the  interface. hyperlinks are used for navigation in the 3d  scenes (in both layers). figure 4 illustrates 2lip reference  implementation: copernicus – the 3d encyclopedia.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1322


   figure 4. copernicus encyclopedia – 2lip implementation.  information-rich virtual environments  in [5], chen et al. presented text layout taxonomy for  information-rich virtual environments and investigated  two methods for rendering text in 3d scene: ‘within-the- world (wwd)’ (object-space) and ‘heads-up display  (hud)’ (viewport-space). hud technique was significantly  better than wwd, where text projected onto faces of  objects in a 3d scene undergo pitch, yaw, and roll  transformations. polys et al. had similar results [21]. their  experiment showed that viewport interfaces outperformed  object space layouts on nearly all counts of accuracy, time,  and ratings of satisfaction and difficulty across tasks. the  authors also suggested the development and evaluation of a  richer set of viewport space layout capabilities.   readability of text on textured background  prior research has investigated the visual properties of the  background that affect the readability of text [25]. a series  of experiments conducted by scharff et al. have identified  the contrast and spatial frequency content of the  background texture as factors affecting the readability of  text. in the study of the effects of four levels of textured  backgrounds (plain, small, medium, and large) on the  legibility of text, hill and scharff found that plain  backgrounds yielded faster search times [13].  in [12], harrison and vicente report an experimental  evaluation of transparent menu usage. in the study they  used a variably-transparent, text menu superimposed over  different backgrounds: text pages, wire-frame images, and  solid images. they compared standard text with proposed  anti-interference (ai) font. the results show, that there is  no significant performance difference between 0% (opaque)  and 50% transparency level. ai fonts were more  interference resistant (but the difference was visible only at  higher transparency levels). authors conclude that although  their experiment was designed as a text menu selection task,  the results can be generalized to text legibility in other ui  contexts beyond menus.  augmented reality  the research on presenting text on textured background is  also relevant for augmented reality (ar), as presenting  augmenting information can take place in different  environmental conditions that may be present [9].   in [1], azuma and furmanski describe and evaluate  different algorithms of dynamic 2d virtual labels placement  for an ar view-management component. their user study  demonstrated that in practice, human subjects were able to  read labels fastest with the algorithms that most quickly  prevented overlap, even if placement was not ideal.  in [18], leykin and tuceryan describe automatic  determination of text readability over textured backgrounds  for ar systems. they developed a classification method  that, for a particular textured background, predicts if a text  with certain features (e.g., font size and weight)  superimposed on it will result in a readable or unreadable  text. their results confirm that background variations only  affect readability when the text contrast is low.   in [10], gabbard et al. examined the effects on user  performance of outdoor background textures, changing  outdoor illuminance values, and text drawing styles in a text  identification task using an optical, see-through ar system.  they reported significant effects for all these variables.    figure 5. background textures and text drawing styles [10].  they designed low-level text identification task: they  selected six background textures of commonly-found  objects in an urban setting and created six text drawing  styles based on previous research in typography, color  theory, and hci text design (see figure 5). three of the text  styles (billboard, red, and green) were static, meaning that  the text color did not change, and three of the text styles  were active, meaning that the text color changed depending  upon the outdoor background texture. the results of their  study suggest using the billboard and green text drawing  styles; surprisingly active text drawing styles did not  perform better relative to static styles.  as we already mentioned, first mobile ar applications  finally appeared on the market. on figure 6 we present two  such applications: presselite’s metro paris subway (it  displays information about paris businesses when you look  at the city through iphone's camera) and wikitude world  browser for the android platform.    figure 6. augmented reality on iphone and android.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1323


    figure 7. cnn news and world of warcraft ui.  television, entertainment and games  integration of text with textured background is taking place  in the television and entertainment business, since there is  often a need to overlay text-based information onto a real- world video scene. the most common examples are  televised sporting events and news (figure 7 shows larry  king live on cnn, where information is rendered as  saturated text on a 2d semi-transparent background).  another example of integration of text with textured  background is subtitling (closed captioning), which is  common in many countries. it is a technique, where text on  screen is representing speech and sound effects  synchronized as closely as possible to the sound. people  using subtitling range from those who have problems with  hearing, to people with good hearing who use subtitles  translated to their native languages.  for digital television services much thought has been given  to the display of text and graphics, and a detailed  specification can be found in [7]. examples of these  recommendations include:  • when choosing a font, consider its readability. favor a  sans serif font over a serif one.  • light text on a dark background is easier to read on a tv  screen (negative image polarity).  • mixed case is ideal, but when choosing one case only,  then favor lower case text over upper case.  • avoid italic, underlined, oblique, condensed or fancy  fonts; avoid flashing and scrolling text.  some techniques of integrating text with static/animated  textured background have been adopted into operating  systems (e.g., macos x and linux, where semi-transparent  terminals are favored by many users), virtual realities (e.g.,  second life) and many games (e.g., world of warcraft - to  show messages, descriptions of items, etc, see figure 7).  however, they still seem to be far from reaching their  potential. one reason for the limited acceptance is related to  a conventional belief that textured background affects  readability of textual information too much.  in this paper we aim to explore the effects of different  techniques of integrating text with video and animated 3d  graphics on text readability. in the next section we describe  formative evaluation designed to find initial values of  transparency levels for billboard styles and font sizes for  the full study.      figure 8. left: different transparency levels of billboards;  right: different font sizes for all text drawing styles.  formative evaluation  an informal plot study was performed to understand how  users perceive and interact with different text drawing  styles across the different background conditions. the goal  of the formative evaluation was to find initial values of  transparency levels for billboard styles and font sizes for  the full study. 6 phd students participated in the pilot study.  we selected 27 images for backgrounds; the set was  balanced for colors and texture (we used histogram-based  methods). the study consisted of two parts:  • in the first part we wanted to find the best transparency  level for the billboard styles (transparency attribute refers  to the panel on which the text is drawn – not to the text  itself). the users were presented with the 2x27 (polarity x  background) sets of six short text paragraphs that were  displayed on top of the prepared image backgrounds (see  figure 8). the paragraphs were rendered on semi- transparent panels – the transparency was ranging from  30% to 80% for the both types of image polarity  (positive: black characters on white panels and negative:  white characters on black panels). the participants were  asked to choose the paragraphs of text they liked best by  simply clicking on a particular text section.   • in the second part we wanted to find the best font size for  all text drawing styles. users were presented with the  2x4x27 (polarity x text drawing style x background) sets  of three short text paragraphs that were displayed on top  of the prepared image backgrounds (see figure 8). the  text of each passage comprised of a font from one of the  three font size conditions: 12, 13, and 14 in windows  presentation foundation (wpf) scale (the corresponding  conversions is: standard windows font size = wpf font  size * 72.0 / 96.0). like in the first step, the participants  were asked to choose the parts of the text they liked best  by simply clicking on a particular text section.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1324


pilot results and design impact  transparency: in the first part we wanted to find the best  transparency level for the billboard styles (transparency of  the panel on which the text is drawn). the average  transparency for positive image polarity (black characters  on white panels) was 68.1% and for negative polarity  (white characters on black panels) was 55.9%.  font size: in the second part we wanted to find the best font  size for all text drawing styles. the average font size across  all text drawing styles was 13.29. for the billboard style the  average was 13.09, for the ai style the average was 13.43  while for shadow style the average was 13.37. the results  have not enough statistical power to draw any real  conclusions here.   the initial data and observations were used to improve the  billboard styles and to choose the font size for the final  study. this included:  • selecting two levels of transparency: 70% for black text  on white and 55% for white text on black;  • choosing a 13 point arial font size (wpf scale) for all  text drawing styles.  evaluation  through previous user studies, we have observed that  reading text in virtual and ar environments can be not only  difficult, but more importantly, is essential to many other  typical user tasks. in addition, little work has been done to  research how best to display readable text on top of a video  background and 3d graphics on a computer screen. based  on these observations, we conducted a study that examined  the effects of varying:  • text drawing styles: (a) “plain/standard” text, (b)  “billboard” (text rendered on a semi-transparent panel),  (c) text with “anti-interference” (ai) font enhancement  [12], and (d) text with shadow;  • image polarity: (a) positive (dark characters appear on a  light background, e.g., black on white) and (b) negative  (light characters appear on a dark background);  • background: (a) compilation of short videos taken in the  city/nature environments and (b) compilation of short  videos recorded in world of warcraft game;  on readability of text. table 1 summarizes the variables we  systematically examined.  independent variables no. of variables type of variable  image polarity 2 positive, negative   text drawing style 4 plain, billboard, ai, shadow  background 2 video, 3d  table 1. summary of variables studied in experiment.  in the following we will describe our study in detail. first  we discuss the evaluation setup and the method used in the  experiment. this discussion is followed by the description  of the materials and the procedure used in this evaluation.  finally we present and discuss the results of the experiment.   participants  20 students, researchers and members of staff with normal,  or corrected-to-normal, vision participated in the  experiment. 10 of the participants were native english  speakers. 4 of our participants were female. the  participants ranged in age from 24 to 55, with 14  participants in the 24-30 range and 6 participants in 30-55  range. 9 participants were phd students, 9 had higher  education, and 2 were post-doctoral researchers. most  participants (80%) reported reading from computer screen  for more than 6h a day. subjects were given a bottle of  wine for their participation.  equipment  different types of multimedia devices can and are used for  reading text on top of video and 3d backgrounds. in our  experiment we used two intel centrino duo laptop  computers equipped with 2gb of memory (ibm t60p),  ati mobility firegl v5200 graphics card, which have 14”  screens with resolution of 1400x1050 pixels. the computer  operating system used was microsoft’s windows xp. the  test application used for the evaluation was developed using  windows presentation foundation. the participants sat in a  lab which was illuminated by overhead fluorescent lights.  reading task  first of all, we want to make it clear that the task is a  foreground only task – reading. we did not measure  anything about user's awareness of background content or  changes (i.e., this was not a divided attention task).  different possible measures could be used to determine the  effects of varying text drawing style, image polarity and  background type on reading performance. in choosing a  task for the study, we looked for one that is both valid  (dillon [8] points out that many studies into reading  performance bear little resemblance to normal act of  reading) and that is recognized for being able to detect  significant differences.   tasks in which participants identify spelling mistakes or  scan the text to find a target word promote skimming  behavior. post-reading comprehension tests (e.g., nelson- denny reading test [24]) are the other option. however,  people tend to look for the main points rather than reading  the text thoroughly.  we decided to use a modified proof reading task that was  introduced by jorna and snyder [15] and was successfully  used by bernard et al. and darroch et al. [3,6]. this task  introduces word substitution errors, making sentences  incomprehensible and forces the subjects to read and  comprehend the sentence. for example, the word “carrot”  could be substituted for the word “car” in the sentence “i  drive a car”, thus makes the sentence incomprehensible to  someone reading it. most words used for substitution were  constrained in two ways: (a) the substituted word rhymed  with the original word, and (b) the substituted word varied  grammatically from the original word.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1325


  the task is realistic because subjects must read the entire  passage in order to recognize substituted words. the  substituted words were common english words that were  clearly out of context. we wanted to ensure that native and  not-native english speakers would have no problem in  identifying the errors.  font and passages  we decided to use sans serif font (arial) for displaying text  (it has been found that sans serif fonts are preferred by  subjects in reading text from computer screen [3]). text  was presented to participants at a 13-point font size (see  previous section: formative evaluation). at the resolution  used in this study it had a point height of 2 mm. text was  anti-aliased.    the conditions were compared by having participants read  text passages “as accurately and as quickly as possible” for  substitution words (from 0 to 5 in each passage, m = 2.9).  participants were not told the number of substitution words  in each passage. the length of passages was adjusted to  have approximately the same number of characters (m =  151.6 words per passage, s.d. = 1.42). the number of  characters per line: 60 without spaces/70 with spaces.  text for the passages was taken from microsoft’s encarta  encyclopedia2; specifically from life science – mammals  category. the passages were written at approximately the  same reading level and discussed similar topics.   eighteen passages were created, 2 for the training session  and 16 for the main experiment. the order in which the 18  passages were presented was the same for all participants.  figure 9 shows an example of a training passage. the  substitution words are marked in red.   goat is a common name for cloven-hoofed, pink mammals closely  related to the sheep. the two differ in that the goat's train is shorter and  the hollow horns are long and directed upward, backward, and outward,  while those of the sheep are spirally twisted. the male goats have  beards, unlike sheep, and differ further by the characteristic strong odor  they give off in the rutting season. in the wild state, goats are nomadic  and are generally found in mountainous habitats. they are agile animals  adept at making long, flying leaps from rock to rock, landing with both  front wings close together. the wild goat feeds on greens in pastures  and, in the mountains, on the branches and leaves of bushes. a number  of breeds of goat are cheese domestically throughout the world. several  million are raised in the united states. the goat is used for meat, as a  milk producer, and as a pen.  figure 9. example passage from the experiment.  measurements  like in [3,6], the study measured readability by both  examining reading time and reading accuracy. the test  application recorded (a) the time taken to read each passage  and (b) the number of identified errors in each passage.   in addition to measuring time and accuracy, we developed a  questionnaire to measure participants’ subjective  impressions of the text drawing styles. the questionnaire  consisted of three parts:                                                             2 http://encarta.msn.com/   • in the first part we used the perceived aesthetics scale  [17] to collect impressions on aesthetics (many recent  findings stress the importance of studying the aesthetic  aspect of hci design [29]). we selected 5 aesthetic  terms: (a) chaotic/clean, (b) boring/interesting, (c)  confusing/clear, (d) ugly/beautiful, and (e) non- aesthetic/aesthetic.  • the second part was based on the questionnaire for user  interaction satisfaction (quis) developed by  shneiderman [26]. in this part we asked the participants  to rate text’s characters (hard to read/easy to read), the  image of the characters (fuzzy/sharp) and the shape of the  characters (barely legible/very legible).  • in the third part the user was asked to answer if for the  given text drawing style, the background is: (a)  distracting/not distracting, and (b) not visible/visible.  in all parts of the questionnaire the subjects could  discriminate and rate the text drawing styles when they  viewed them side-by-side (see figure 1). they were asked  to use the set of sliders with 7-point scales.  procedure  each test session lasted approximately forty minutes, and  started with an introduction and a training session (2  passages) to allow the subject to get familiarized with the  test application, the interface, and the test procedure. after  the subjects indicated that they were satisfied, we  proceeded with the actual trials.  the test application’s interface used to present passages to  participants was designed similarly to the one developed by  darroch et al. [6]. it had a “go” button that was pressed to  begin reading the passage and “done” button, pressed upon  completing the passage (see figure 1). users were  presented with a series of sixteen passages and for each  pressed the “go” button, read the passage (clicking on any  word substitution), and then pressing “done”. they were  asked to read the text passages “as accurately and as  quickly as possible” and to read them only once. clicking  on word substitution (using the mouse pointer) caused the  application to replace such word with the right one (the  participants received immediate feedback on the correctness  of their actions). the participants were instructed to keep  questions and comments for the breaks between passages.  to avoid boredom and eye-strain effects the users were told  that they can rest during the breaks. the number of  substituted words in passages was not told to the  participants.  after being presented with all 16 passages to read, users  were given the questionnaire and asked to directly compare  all text drawing styles (see previous section and figure 1).  independent variables  independent variable 1: image polarity  document and text design guidelines often include  recommendations for appropriate color combinations, many  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1326


of which recommend high contrast between text and  background with particular emphasis on the traditional  black on white [8,11]. however, as we already mentioned  in section 2, television standards recommend light text on a  dark background (negative image polarity). in our study we  decided to examine both types of image polarity:   • “positive presentation” – in our case black text on a white  semitransparent panel or black text with white outlining  or a white shadow;   • “negative presentation” – in our case white text on a  black semitransparent panel or white text with black  outlining or a black shadow.    figure 10. selected text drawing styles (negative and positive).  independent variable 2: text drawing style  we selected four text drawing styles (see figure 10) for our  experiment:   • “plain text” – standard text without any decoration;  • “billboard style” – based on the pilot results (section 3),  we designed the billboard styles for the main experiment:   (a) for positive image polarity – saturated black text ([0,  0, 0, 255] in rgba space) on a semitransparent white  ([255, 255, 255, 178] in rgba space; 70% transparency)  rectangular background;  (b) for negative image polarity – using a saturated white  text ([255, 255, 255, 255] in rgba space) on a  semitransparent black ([255, 255, 255, 140] in rgba  space; 55% transparency) rectangular background.  •  “anti-interference style” – font enhancement proposed  by harrison et al. [12], as a potential interference  resistant font technique (since an ai font has two  opposing color components, it remains visible in any  color background). in ai fonts, the opposing outlines of  the text are rendered in a color which has the maximal  contrast to the color of the text. in our case:  (a) for positive image polarity – black text with a white  halo around letters;  (b) for negative image polarity – white text with a black  halo around letters.  • “shadow style” – text drawing style used for example in  microsoft word (font > effects > shadow) and world of  warcraft game (e.g., for communication between  gamers). in our case:  (a) black text with a white shadow (positive presentation)  (b) white text with a black shadow (negative presentation)  3d video 0 64 128 red green blue   0 64 128 hue saturation lightness 3d video figure 11. the two video compilations: characteristics.  independent variable 3: background  in our study we wanted to examine reading text on top of  video and 3d backgrounds. we therefore created two short  (30 seconds long) video compilations:  •  “video” – the first one consisted of short videos taken  in the city and nature environments. 50% of the videos  were taken in city surroundings: we chose video clips to  be representative of commonly-found objects in an urban  setting:  streets full of traffic and people. the remaining  50% were taken in the nature environment; they were  showing objects such as grass, foliage, sky, mountains.  • “3d” – the second one consisted of short videos  recorded in the world of warcraft game. with more than  11.5 million subscribers, world of warcraft is currently  the most-subscribed mmorpg. everyday, millions of  gamers read messages, descriptions of items (figure 7)  which are displayed on top of animated 3d background.   the two prepared video compilations employed in the  experiment were designed to depict typical reading  situations in both 3d environments (e.g., games) and ar  applications. figure 11 illustrates their visual properties: (a)  motion dynamics of the videos (calculation based on the  distance between video frames; we used edgehistogram  descriptor from the mpeg-7 standard), (b and c) color.  more information: http://www.grey-eminence.org/chi.  experimental design  the experiment was a 2×2×4 mixed, within-subject design  on the following factors:  • image polarity: positive and negative presentation  • text drawing style: plain text, billboard style, anti- interference style, shadow style;  • background: video, 3d  we counterbalanced presentation of independent variables  by means of latin square design.  hypotheses  h1: comparing to positive presentation, negative  presentation will result in faster and more accurate  performance since it is commonly and successfully used in  television business.

  h2: because the billboard style partially obscures the  background, it will result in the best reading performance.   h3: the plain text styles will result in slow and inaccurate  performance, because they can be temporarily completely  unreadable (e.g., white text on a white cloud).  h4: the more visually complex (in terms of level of detail,  color – see figure 11) “video” background will result in  slower and less accurate reading performance, since its  complexity will interfere more with the task.  objective results  in this section we present the results of the experiment in  relation with the aforementioned hypotheses. we collected  a total of 320 reading times and accuracy measurements (20  subjects * 2 image polarities * 4 text drawing styles * 2  backgrounds), and 1600 measurements of subjective  impressions (20 subjects * 10 questionnaire parts * 2 image  polarities * 4 text drawing styles).   we analyzed our results with analysis of variance  (anova). with anova we modeled our experiment as a  repeated-measures design that considers subject a random  variable and all other independent variables as fixed (see  table 1). bonferroni procedure was used for evaluating the  pairwise comparisons.   reading time  times for completion of reading a passage were recorded to  a hundredth of a second and then normalized on the overall  average completion time. normalization was used to  remove any effects of base reading speed among  participants. figure 12 illustrates the normalized reading  times and standard deviations.   analysis of the reading time revealed a significant main  effect of text drawing style, f(3, 57) = 26.87, p<0.0001.  none of the other main effects were significant, nor were  any of the interactions. post-hoc comparisons of means  revealed the following:  • the slowest reading speed came from the positive “plain  text” style (black text), p<0.001. the results support h3.  • the negative “plain text” style (white text) was  significantly slower to read than both billboard styles  (p<0.005) and the negative ai style (p=0.02).  reading accuracy  overall accuracy was very high (94%). analyzing the  percentage of detected substituted words for each  polarity/text drawing style/background combinations  revealed no significant differences (p>0.05) in accuracy  (see figure 12 for means and standard deviations).  similarly to [3], we believe that an explanation for such  outcome is that participants slow their rate of reading for  less readable passages to achieve roughly the same level of  accuracy. based on bernard’s [3] example, we calculated  an adjusted accuracy measure (the ratio of time taken to  read the passage to the percentage of errors found).     reading time reading accuracy  polarity t. drawing 3d video 3d video    m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d.  positive plain 65.36 9.11 68.27 7.99 0.93 0.15 0.93 0.15  billboard 55.60 7.33 52.68 7.43 0.98 0.08 0.99 0.06  ai 59.45 8.83 58.24 8.15 0.95 0.14 0.87 0.21  shadow 55.81 6.49 59.63 9.35 0.88 0.19 0.92 0.15 negative plain 58.51 7.91 64.89 8.53 0.89 0.16 0.95 0.13  billboard 55.41 7.62 53.71 5.78 0.96 0.09 0.98 0.08  ai 57.20 6.68 53.88 6.19 0.97 0.10 0.95 0.11  shadow 57.62 9.34 56.19 7.01 0.93 0.14 0.96 0.12 reading time 30.00 40.00 50.00 60.00 70.00 positive plain positive billboard positive ai positive shadow negative plain negative billboard negative ai negative shadow 3d video reading accuracy 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 positive plain positive billboard positive ai positive shadow negative plain negative billboard negative ai negative shadow figure 12. reading time and accuracy.  analysis of the adjusted accuracy measure revealed a  significant main effect of text drawing style, f(3, 57) =  8.91, p<0.0001 and polarity, f(1, 19) = 12.73, p=0.002.  post-hoc comparisons of means revealed the following:  • as expected, the negative presentation resulted in  significantly faster/more accurate performance than the  positive presentation, p=0.002. these results support h1.  • the billboard styles were significantly less error prone  than the plain text drawing styles, p<0.05.   summary  background. the readability results were relatively  insensitive to the type of background; the subjects had  comparable results for the “3d” and the visually more  complex “video” backgrounds (these results refute h4).  text drawing style. the billboard drawing styles supported  the fastest and most accurate performance. the  semitransparent white and black panels partially occluded  the video and 3d backgrounds, resulting in easier to read  text regardless of the background distractions (to a degree,  these results support h2). the anti-interference (ai) and  shadow styles had comparable times. subjects performed  slowest with the plain text styles.   polarity. the negative presentation resulted in significantly  faster/more accurate performance than the positive  presentation.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1328


subjective results  subjective results were measured for two independent  variables: image polarity and text drawing style. the  background was randomly assigned for all parts of the  questionnaire. we analyzed the results with anova and  bonferroni procedure.  aesthetics  we will present three from five collected impressions on  aesthetics since the results of the (a) chaotic/clean and  confusing/clear, and (b) ugly/beautiful and non- aesthetic/aesthetic categories were basically the same:  • clearness. significant main effects of all variables and  their interactions were found (p<0.0001). pairwise  comparisons revealed that the billboard styles (both  positive and negative) were perceived as being much less  confusing than all other styles.  • interestingness. significant main effects of all variables  were found (p<0.0001). the billboard styles were  perceived as being the most interesting, followed by the  ai and shadow styles.    • aesthetics. significant main effects of all variables and  their interactions were found (p<0.0001). again, the  billboard styles were perceived as the most aesthetic.   in all cases the negative presentation was ranked higher, on  average, than the positive presentation. furthermore, users  found the positive ai and shadow styles much less clear  and less aesthetic than their negative equivalents.  text readability (from quis)  the second part was based on quis; we asked the  participants to rate text’s characters (hard to read/easy to  read), the image of the characters (fuzzy/sharp) and the  shape of the characters (barely legible/very legible).  • difficulty in reading. significant main effects of all  variables and their interactions were found (p<0.0001).  the billboard styles were perceived the easiest to read,  followed by the negative ai and shadow styles.  • text sharpness. significant main effects of all variables  and their interactions were found (p<0.0001). pairwise  comparisons revealed that the billboard styles were  perceived as being sharper than other styles. positive ai  and shadow styles were perceived as being the fuzziest.  • text legibility. significant main effects of all variables  and their interactions were found (p<0.0001). the  billboard styles were perceived as being the most legible,  followed by the negative ai and shadow styles.  background visibility  in the third part the user was asked to answer if for the  given text drawing style, the background is: (a)  distracting/not distracting, and (b) not visible/visible.  • distraction. significant main effects of all variables and  their interactions were found (p<0.0001). comparisons  revealed that the billboard styles were perceived as being  the most immune to background distractions.  • visibility. significant main effects of all variables and  their interactions were found (p<0.0001). billboard styles  were perceived as being the most obscuring.  discussion  our most important finding is clear empirical evidence that  user performance on a task, which we believe is  representative of a variety of 3d and augmented reality  applications, is significantly affected by image polarity, text  drawing style, and their interaction. the evaluation results  can also help to understand better the relationship between  text drawing styles and users’ perception of aesthetics and  text readability.     aesthetics text readability (from quis) background is…  polarity text  drawing  confusing/clear boring/interesting non-aesthetic/  aesthetic  hard to read/  easy to read  fuzzy/sharp not legible/legible distracting/not  distracting  not visible/visible    m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d. m s.d.  positive plain 2.87 1.38 2.10 1.19 3.19 1.22 2.24 1.03 4.79 1.66 2.31 1.25 1.85 0.99 6.11 1.01  billboard 6.48 0.67 5.65 1.27 5.58 1.21 6.65 0.54 6.69 0.57 6.51 0.83 6.36 0.87 1.92 0.72  ai 2.70 1.48 3.40 1.83 2.51 1.58 2.95 1.75 1.70 0.78 2.73 1.38 2.86 1.38 4.53 1.16  shadow 2.21 1.09 3.27 1.23 2.22 1.22 2.58 1.19 2.28 1.18 2.59 0.94 2.90 1.27 4.90 1.01 negative plain 3.53 1.50 2.62 1.53 3.83 1.28 2.94 1.47 4.90 1.66 2.98 1.32 2.33 1.39 5.42 1.29  billboard 6.52 0.70 5.91 1.17 6.05 0.90 6.61 0.61 6.54 0.60 6.44 0.76 6.04 1.02 2.21 0.83  ai 4.33 1.31 4.11 1.84 4.32 1.49 4.53 1.07 4.22 1.54 4.37 1.29 3.56 1.33 4.52 1.29  shadow 3.73 1.34 3.87 0.88 3.98 1.44 4.10 1.50 4.39 1.07 4.02 1.24 3.60 1.57 4.27 1.06 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 confusing (1) - clear (7) boring (1) - interesting (7) non-aesthetic (1) - aesthetic (7) hard to read (1) - easy to read (7) fuzzy (1) - sharp (7) barely legible (1) - very legible (7) distracting (1) - not distracting (7) not vissible (1) - vissible (7) positive plain positive billboard positive ai positive shadow negative plain negative billboard negative ai negative shadow figure 13. subjective results from the questionnaire (aesthetics, text readability, and background visibility).  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1329


  like most controlled user-based studies, this one had many  limitations that restrict the generality of our findings:  although we tested two qualitatively different video  compilations, we still managed to test only a small sample  of possible backgrounds; furthermore, our task did not  require the subjects to interact in real ar setting.  conclusions  in this paper we presented an investigation into the effects  of varying: (a) text drawing styles (plain, billboard, anti- interference, shadow); (b) image polarity (positive and  negative); and (c) background style (video and 3d) on text  readability. results showed that there was little difference  in reading performance for the video and 3d backgrounds.  furthermore, the negative presentation outperformed the  positive presentation. the billboard drawing styles  supported the fastest and most accurate performance;  subjective comments from participants showed a preference  for the billboard style as well. we therefore suggest, for  reading tasks, that designers of interfaces for games, video,  and augmented reality provide billboard style to maximize  readability for the widest range of applications.  in [4], bolter and grusin focus on the relationship between  visual digital expressions (such as virtual reality) and  earlier media forms (written text, photography). they argue  that digital forms both borrow from and seek to surpass  earlier forms; they give this process the name  “remediation”. we believe that integrating text with video  (e.g., ar applications) and with 3d graphics (e.g., 3d  comic books) can be one of the remediations of the  electronic text. if we develop new usable ways of  presenting such information on screen, which enhance  reading activity, if we can provide materials, which exceed  current text’s limitations, this may ultimately result in  better, more effective conveying information,  and more  engaging education.  acknowledgments  the work presented in this paper has been funded in part by  science foundation ireland under grant no. sfi/08/ce/i1380 and  enterprise ireland under grant no. rei1004.  references  1. azuma, r. and furmanski, c. evaluating label placement for  augmented reality view management, in proc. ismar 2004.  2. bell, b., feiner, s., and hollerer, t. view management for  virtual and augmented reality. in proc. uist 2001.  3. bernard, m.l., chaparro, b.s., mills, m.m. and halcomb, c.g.  comparing the effects of text size and format on the readability  of computer-displayed times new roman and arial text.  ijhcs, 2003.  4. bolter, j.d. and grusin, r. remediation: understanding new  media, 2000.  5. chen, j., pyla p., and bowman d., testbed evaluation of  navigation and text display techniques in an information-rich  virtual environment. in proc. virtual reality 2004.  6. darroch, i., goodman, j. brewster, s. and gray, p. the effect of  age and font size on reading text on handheld computers. in  proc. interact 2005.  7. digital television recommendations: http://www.dtg.org.uk/ and  http://www.ofcom.org.uk/   8. dillon, a. reading from paper vs. screens: a critical review of  the empirical literature. ergonomics, 1992.  9. feiner, s., augmented reality: a new way of seeing, scientific  american, 2002.  10. gabbard, j.l., swan, j.e. and hix, d. the effects of text  drawing styles, background textures, and natural lighting on text  legibility in outdoor augmented reality. presence, 2006.  11. gould, j.d., alfaro, l., finn, r., haupt, b. and minuto, a.  reading from crt displays can be as fast as reading from  paper. human factors, 1987.  12. harrison, b.l. and vicente, k.j. an experimental evaluation of  transparent menu usage. in proc. chi 1996.  13. hill, a.l. and scharff, l.f. readability of computer displays as  a function of color, saturation, and background texture.  engineering psychology & cognitive ergonomics, 1999.  14. jankowski, j. and decker, s. 2lip: filling the gap between the  current and the three-dimensional web, in proc. web3d 2009.  15. jorna, g.c. and snyder, h.l. image quality determines  differences in reading performance and perceived image  quality with crt and hard-copy displays. human factors,  1991.  16. larson, k., van dantzich, m., czerwinski, m. and robertson, g.  text in 3d: some legibility results. in proc. chi 2002.  17. lavie, t. and tractinsky, n. assessing dimensions of perceived  visual aesthetics of web sites. ijhcs, 2004.  18. leykin, a. and tuceryan, m. automatic determination of text  readability over textured backgrounds for augmented reality  systems. in proc. ismar 2004.  19. maass, s. and dollner, j. embedded labels for line features in  interactive 3d virtual environments, in proc. afrigraph 2007.  20. nunberg, g. the future of the book, 1997  21. polys, n.f., kim, s. and bowman, d.a. effects of information  layout, screen size, and field of view on user performance in  information-rich virtual environments. in proc. vrst 2005.  22. preim, b., raab, a., and strothotte, t. coherent zooming of  illustrations with 3d-graphics and text. in proc. graphics  interface 1997.  23. ritter, f., sonnet, h., hartmann, k., and strothotte, t.  illustrative shadows: integrating 3d and 2d information  displays. in proc. iui 2003.  24. riverside publishing. nelson-denny reading test, 1993.  25. scharff, l.f., hill, a.l. and ahumada, a.j. predicting the  readability of transparent text. journal of vision, 2002  26. shneiderman, b. and plaisant, c. designing the user interface:  strategies for effective human-computer interaction, 2004.  27. sonnet, h., carpendale, s., and strothotte, t. integrating  expanding annotations with a 3d explosion probe. in proc. avi  2004.  28. sonnet, h., carpendale, s. and strothotte, t. integration of 3d  data and text: the effects of text positioning, connectivity,  and visual hints on comprehension. in proc. interact 2005.  29. tractinsky, n., shoval-katz, a., and ikar, d. what is beautiful  is usable. interacting with computers, 2000.  chi 2010: interaction techniques april 10–15, 2010, atlanta, ga, usa 1330
