  khan et al.       2 abstract   background : long-term biodistribution of nanomaterials used in medicine is largely unknown. this is  the case for alum, the most widely used vaccine adjuvant, which is a nanocrystalline compound  spontaneously forming micron/submicron-sized agglomerates. although generally well tolerated, alum  is occasionally detected within monocyte-lineage cells long after immunization in presumably  susceptible individuals with systemic/neurologic manifestations or autoimmune (inflammatory)  syndrome induced by adjuvants (asia).  methods : on the grounds of preliminary investigations in 252 patients with alum-associated asia  showing both selective increase of circulating ccl2, the major monocyte chemoattractant, and a  variation in the ccl2 gene, we designed mouse experiments to assess biodistribution of vaccine- derived aluminium and of alum-particle fluorescent surrogates injected in muscle. aluminium was  detected in tissues by morin stain and pixe (particle induced xray emission). both 500nm fluorescent  latex beads and vaccine alum agglomerates-sized nanohybrids (al-rho) were used.   results : intramuscular injection of alum-containing vaccine was associated with appearance of  aluminium deposits in distant organs such as spleen, and brain where they were still detected one  year after injection. both fluorescent materials injected into muscle translocated to draining lymph  nodes (dlns) and thereafter were detected associated with phagocytes in blood and spleen. particles  linearly accumulated in brain up to the 6-month endpoint, first found in perivascular cd11b+ cells and  then in microglia and other neural cells. dln ablation dramatically reduced the biodistribution.  cerebral translocation was not observed after direct intravenous injection, but significantly increased in  mice with chronically altered blood-brain-barrier. loss/gain-of-function experiments consistently  implicated ccl2 in systemic diffusion of al-rho particles captured by monocyte-lineage cells, and in  their subsequent neurodelivery. stereotactic particle injection pointed out brain retention as a factor of  progressive particle accumulation.   conclusion : nanomaterials can be transported by mo-lineage cells to dlns, blood, and spleen, and,  similarly to hiv, may use ccl2-dependent mechanisms to penetrate the brain. this occurs at very low  rate in normal conditions explaining good overall tolerance of alum despite its strong neurotoxic  potential. however, continuously escalating doses of this poorly biodegradable adjuvant in the  population may become insidiously unsafe, especially in case of overimmunisation or immature/altered  bbb or high constitutive ccl-2 production.

  khan et al.       4 background   nanomaterials have various innovative medical applications including drug and gene delivery, imaging contrast  fluids, topic antimicrobials, surgery tools and vaccines [1]. due to the growing number of novel compounds and  formulations, data on their specific biodistribution, persistence and toxicity are generally lacking [1], and  clarification regarding how the body handles small particles, especially those which interact with immune cells  [2], is urgently needed. once defined, these basic mechanisms which govern host-particle interactions should  be integrated with specific properties of nanomaterials (size, shape, surface, and solubility) to enable  predictions of their beneficial or adverse effects.   the use of nanomaterials in man is not as contemporary as is recently portrayed. for decades, alum, a  nanocrystalline compound formed of aluminium oxyhydroxide, has been the most commonly used adjuvant in  vaccines. the mechanism by which it stimulates the immune response is incompletely understood [3]. while  alum is generally well tolerated, it is occasionally reported as the cause of disabling health problems in  individuals with ill-defined susceptibility factors [4,5,6]. clinical manifestations attributed to alum are  paradigmatic of the so-called autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (asia), a syndrome  also observed in patients exposed to silicone gel [7]. they include delayed onset of diffuse myalgia [4], chronic  fatigue [8], and stereotyped cognitive dysfunction [9]. the persistence of alum-loaded macrophages is typically  detected at sites of previous injections (up to >12 years), resulting in a specific granuloma called macrophagic  myofasciitis or mmf [4]. although the biopersistence of adjuvants is a priori undesirable, the exact significance  of this remains the subject of some debate since the biodistribution of slowly biodegradable particles following  injection into muscle is currently unknown.  there appears to be a fine balance between the efficacy of alum adjuvant and its potential toxicity, and there is  good evidence that these may be one and the same effect [3]. both the efficacy and the potential toxicity of  alum will be influenced by whether the bioactive nanomaterial remains localized at injection points or rather  scatters and accumulates in distant organs and tissues. a reference study based on isotopic 26al showed poor  (6%) 26al clearance in the urine at day 28 (d28) endpoint after i.m. injection of isotopic alum to rabbits, and  detected 26al, in an unknown form, in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and brain [10]. aluminium oxyhydroxide is  composed of micron/submicron-sized aggregates of nano-sized (ca 13 nm) particles and these aggregates were  initially believed to remain extracellular until their complete solubilisation in interstitial fluids [10]. we now  know that quite the reverse is the case and that antigen presenting cells (apcs) avidly take up alum particles 


  khan et al.       5 [11], and, in so-doing, become long-lived cells [12], and impede alum solubilisation [4,13,14]. inflammatory  monocytes (mos) are attracted into muscle by danger signals through a monocyte chemoattractant protein-1  (mcp-1)/chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2 (ccl2) driven-mechanism, becoming macrophages (mps) and mo- derived dendritic cells (dcs), before migrating to the draining lymph nodes (dlns) [15]. one function of  migratory dcs is to transfer antigenic material to a large network of distant resident apcs [16]. moreover,  injections of alum alone induce significant changes linked to activation of the innate immune system in distant  organs [17]. therefore, we examined whether nanomaterials injected into muscle could translocate to distant  organs as part of a general mechanism linked to phagocytosis and ccl2/mcp-1 signaling. 


  khan et al.       6 methods  mice models.   all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the european guidelines for animal care. to  facilitate mechanistic investigation of particle biodistribution, mice of the b57/b6 genetic background, that are  used to generate genetically-manipulated models, were preferred to more toxic-sensitive mouse strains. male  8-10 week-old c57bl/6, mdx (with leaky bbb), cx3cr1gfp/+ (with gfp reporter gene insertion allowing  visualization of microglia), and ccl2-/- mice were used (jackson, west grove, pa). mice were protected from al- containing materials, fed with manufactured animal food and water ad libitum, and exposed to 12:12 light/dark  cycles. experiments using fluorescent particles were extremely labour intensive and expensive to perform. all  of them were done in triplicate. homogeneity of results made unnecessary to use more than 3 mice per point.  alum administration.   the dose of alum-containing vaccine administered to mice was calibrated to mimick the mean number of doses  received by mmf patients. one dose of commercially available anti-hepatitis b vaccine contains 0.5mg al  according to the product data sheet. based on an average of human body weight of 60kg (most patients being  women), the amount received for each immunization is 8.33μg/kg. the allometric conversion from human to  mouse (fda guidance 5541) gives a final amount of approximately 100μg/kg. 36μl vaccine, which corresponds  to 18μg al, was injected to mimick the cumulative effect induced by 5.2 human doses to 35g mice (the mean  weight at the d180 midtime of brain analysis). this dose represents an equivalent 6.8 human doses in the  youngest animal (27g body weight, 11 weeks of age at sacrifice) and 4.3 in the oldest one (42g at 62 weeks).  furnace atomic absorption spectrometry.   al concentrations were determined in whole ta muscles and brains dried at 37°c and digested with  concentrated hno3 (14 mol/l). digests were allowed to cool before dilution to 10% hno3 with ultra-pure  water. the total aluminium in each digest was measured by thga gfaas, and results were expressed as al  mg/g tissue dry weight.  pixe.   as in normal conditions al may be detected with marked interindividual variations in tissues, de novo  incorporation of aluminium in too low doses does not cause easily detectable changes when global  conventional approaches are used [10]. here we used pixe, a procedure analysing radiations emitted from the  interaction of a proton beam with the matter [19], to detect areas enclosing small al spots. 20μm-thick sections 


  khan et al.       7 carefully protected from environmental al were mounted on fresh formvar films, kept in the cryostat for 6h  and stored under al-free silica gel. mineral and metal ions were detected using the nuclear microprobe of the  centre d'etudes nucléaires de bordeaux-gradignan. a 1mev proton beam focused down to a 2μm spot was  randomly scanned over multiple 500x500μm fields of tissue sections. in case of al signal, re-test of 100x100μm  areas of interest was performed. pixe and rutherford backscattering spectrometry analyses were employed  simultaneously and quantitative results were computed, as previously described [19]. al spots were considered  eligible on 3 criteria: a size of more than 3 pixels (i.e. above the background noise), a depot not colocalized with  si, and a depot surrounded by a rounded halo of decreased intensity (both characteristics limiting confusion  with contamination by external dust overcoming the protection procedures).  synthesis of al-rho particles.   gadolinium oxide nanohybrids with al(oh)3 coating were obtained in three steps: (i) gadolinium oxide  nanoparticles were first synthesized, (ii) polysiloxane shell growth was then induced by hydrolysis- condensation of convenient silane precursors in presence of the nanoparticles, and (iii) the nanohybrids were  coated by the addition of aluminium nitrate and soda in stoichiometric conditions.  chemicals.   gadolinium chloride hexahydrate ([gdcl3, 6h2o], 99.99%), sodium hydroxide (naoh, 99.99%), tetraethyl  orthosilicate (si(oc2h5)4, teos, 98%), (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (h2n(ch2)3-si(oc2h5)3, aptes, 99%),  triethylamine (tea, 99.5%), rhodamine b isothiocyanate (rbitc), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate  (al(no3)3.9h2o, acs reagent ≥ 98%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso, 99.5%) were purchased from sigma-aldrich  (st louis, mo). diethylene glycol (deg, 99%) was purchased from sds carlo erba (france).  preparation of gadolinium oxide core.   a first solution was prepared by dissolving [gdcl3, 6h2o] (0.56g) in 50ml deg at room temperature. a second  solution was prepared by adding a naoh solution (0.49ml, 10m) in 50ml deg. the second solution was  progressively added to the first one, at room temperature, for 15 hours. a transparent colloid of gadolinium  oxide nanoparticles in deg was obtained.  encapsulation of gd2o3 cores by polysiloxane shell.   105μl of aptes and 67μl of teos were added to the 100ml of the gadolinium oxide nanoparticle solution  under stirring at 40°c. 5μl of aptes was previously coupled to 1mg rbitc in dmso (1ml) used as solvent and  then added to the colloidal solution. after 1h, 1913μl of a deg solution (0.1m of tea, 10m of water) was 


  khan et al.       8 added. the whole coating procedure was repeated three more times (with no more addition of rbitc), every  24h. the final mixture was stirred for 48h at 40°c. the obtained solution could be stored at room temperature  for weeks without alteration.  coating of fluorescent nanohybrids with a al(oh)3 shell.   2.5ml of the colloidal solution was diluted by 2 to obtain a 5ml solution in deg. 75mg of aluminium nitrate  nonahydrate was dissolved in 10ml of water before addition to the colloidal solution. the resulting mixture  was stirred for 5min and 4ml of a soda solution (0.2m) was added before stirring for 1hour.  purification.   purification of al-rho was performed by tangential filtration through vivaspin filtration membranes  (mwco=10kda) purchased from sartorius stedim biotech (france). the colloidal solution was introduced into  20ml vivaspin tubes, and centrifuged at 4100rpm. this step was repeated several times, by filling the tubes  with water and centrifuging again, until the desired purification rate was reached (≥ 100). the purified colloidal  solution was freeze dried for storage in 5 pillboxes, using a christ alpha 1-2 lyophilisator. the compound  contained 4µg al per µl of al-rho suspension. control transmission electron microscopy showed non-fibrous  particles sizing about 10nm typical of aluminium hydroxyde (traditional precipated alum). similarly to vaccine  alum, they formed agglomerates of submicronic /micronic size. immunological properties of such traditional  alum-protein precipitates are quite similar to those of the reference adjuvant approved by fda (al  oxyhydroxyde : alhydrogel®) and differ from other formulations not licensed for human use (18).  peripheral injections of fluorescent nanomaterials.   two types of fluorescent nanomaterials were used: exploratory polychromatic flbs (500nm fluorospheres,  polysciences, pa), and confirmatory al-rho nanohybrids constructed with a rhodamine containing core and an  al(oh)3 shell. flbs were used first because they offer several characteristics that facilitate their detection in  tissues, including strong fluorescence, spheric appearance and homogeneous size. this allowed us to get clear  picture of what was happening in terms of biodistribution of these avidly phagocytozed particles. al rho  particles were less fluorescent, and more heterogeneous in shape and size than flbs but represented better  alum adjuvant surrogates. almost all biodistribution experiments performed with flbs in wt mice were also  done with al-rho. in contrast flbs and al rho were differentially used in mutated/genetically-modified mice:  flbs were preferred to study particle biodistribution in mdx mice with bbb alterations and when the gfp  marker was used (i.e. cx3cr1gfp/+ mice with fluorescent microglia, gfp+ bmt studies); al-rho particles were 


  khan et al.       9 preferred in gain/loss of ccl2/mcp-1 function studies designed on the basis of preliminary results on the ccl2  status of alum-intolerant humans.  flb suspension diluted at 1:1 in pbs contained 1.8 1011 particles per ml. a total volume of 40μl (20μl in each  ta muscle) was injected, corresponding to a total amount of 7.2 109 particles. the same volume of al-rho  suspension was injected in ta muscles. pbs-injected mice were used as controls. tissues including popliteal and  inguinal dlns, spleen, brain and blood were collected at various time points post injection. three mice (n=3)  were included per group at each time point for both injected materials and their controls. other administration  routes were compared to the standard i.m. injection, including s.c. injection of 20μl flbs in each hindlimb, and  i.v. injection of 40 μl flbs in the tail vein.  stereotactic cerebral injections.   mice were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. al-rho suspension (0.5μl) was stereotactically injected in  the striatum using a 1μl hamilton syringe. biodistribution of i.c. injected al-rho to cervical dlns, assessed by  serial sectioning of the whole cervical region, and spleen, was compared to biodistribution to popliteal dln and  spleen of the same amount of al-rho injected in ta muscle.  pharmacological and physical migration blockade.   the prostaglandin analog bw245c, an agonist of pgd2 receptor, was used to inhibit apc migration as  previously reported [20]. since bw-245c is active for 2 days after injection, bw245c (100nm, cat.no.12050,  cayman chemical, mi, usa) was injected twice in ta muscle: it was first co-injected with flbs at d0 and a  second time alone at d2, dlns being removed for examination at d4. untreated flb-injected mice were used as  controls. in another set of experiments dlns were surgically ablated, and mice immediately injected with flbs  in ta muscle.  loss and gain of ccl2 function experiments.   exploratory analyses performed in mmf patients with asia (see supplementary information section) yielded a  ccl2 signal in form of (1) selective increase of ccl2 in the serum of mmf patients compared to healthy  controls, and (2) a given haplotype in the ccl2 gene tending to be more frequent in mmf patients than in the  general population. these results incited us to use mouse models to explore the role of ccl2 in the  biodisposition of particulate materials. loss of ccl2 function studies were done using ccl2-/- mice injected i.m.  with 40μl al-rho. gain of ccl2 function experiments consisted first in i.m. co-injection of 10μl murine rccl2  (100μg/ml; r&d, mn) with 40μl al-rho. dlns were removed at d4, spleen, brain and blood at d21. in other 


  khan et al.       10 experiments murine rccl2 was infused into brain through a catheter stereotactically inserted into the striatum  at d7 post-al-rho, fed by a subcutaneously implanted osmotic micropump fixed into the neck (0.25μl/h alzet  brain infusion kit, charles river, france). rccl2 was infused during 14 days (diffusion rate 180pg/day), with or  without rccl2 i.m. injection concurrent with al-rho injection. at d21 post al-rho injection, animals were  sacrificed, and blood and tissues were collected. for controls, osmotic pumps filled with pbs were used.  tissue preparation and particle counting.   mice under terminal anaesthesia were transcardially perfused with pbs followed by ice-cold 4%  paraformaldehyde (pfa) in 0.1m phosphate buffer. tissues and organs were removed, post-fixed in pfa for 4  hours at 4°c, immersed overnight at 4°c in a 30% sucrose solution, and quickly frozen. whole brains were  serially cut into coronal cryosections of 40μm, spleen and muscle into 20μm, and dlns into 10μm, and stored  at −20°c until particle counting or treatment. brain sections were successively deposited on 10 different  superfrost® slides in order to obtain 10 identical series, thus allowing determination of total particle content by  multiplying by 10 the number of particles found in one series. a similar approach was used for dlns and  spleen. blood was collected by heart puncture and 100μl were smeared for particle counting.  immunohistochemistry and morin staining.   immunostaining was done using commercial primary antibodies routinely used in the lab, raised against cd11b  (1/200, abd serotec, oxford, uk), f4/80 (1/50, abcam, cambridge, uk), gfap (1/200, dakocytomation,  france), vimentin (1/500 dakocytomation,trappes, france), collagen iv (1/100 millipore, temecula, ca), ng2  (1/200, millipore, molsheim, france), map2 (1/100, sigma-aldrich, lyon, france), and il1β (1/100, abcam,  paris, france) or nonspecific mouse igg (jackson immunoresearch, suffolk, uk). then, biotinylated anti-rat and  anti-rabbit antibodies (1/200, vector laboratories, paris, france) were used accordingly, and revealed using  alexa fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1/200 invitrogen, cergy-pontoise, france). neuron labeling was done  using neurotrace® blue fluorescent nissl stain according to the manufacturer (invitrogen). al was stained with  morin (m4008-2g, sigma-aldrich) used as 0.2g dissolved in a solution consisting of 0.5% acetic acid in 85%  ethanol [21]. formation of a fluorescent complex with al was detected under a 420nm excitation wavelength  as an intense green fluorescence with a characteristic 520nm emission. notably nanohybrids (gd2o3) core  encapsulated by polysiloxane shell were not positively stained by morin. in contrast, when coated with al(oh)3,  these particles were strongly positive for morin. fluorescence microscopy and spectral analyses were done  using carl zeiss light and confocal microscopes. 


  khan et al.       11 cell isolation from blood and tissues and flow cytometry.   for blood cell immunophenotyping, 100μl blood was treated with edta and stained with fitc-conjugated  antibodies. erythrocytes were lysed using hypotonic lysis solution, and then cells were washed with dmem and  sorted using a moflo cell sorter (beckman coulter, villepinte, france). cells were extracted from tissues of  exsanguinated mice perfused with pbs. tissues were removed and freshly dissociated in dmem. dlns and  spleen were dissociated in dmem containing 0.2% collagenase-b (roche diagnostics, meylan, france) and 0.2%  trypsine-edta at 37°c for 45 min twice. brain tissue was dissociated in 1% trypsin-hbss (thermo scientific  hyclone, south logan, uk) containing 100u/ml dnase (roche diagnostics). cell suspension were filtered and  counted. cd45+ or cd11b+ cells were isolated using magnetic cell sorting (macs, miltenyi biotec, paris, france)  and stained with one of the following antibodies and their isotypes: fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc-conjugated  anti-cd11b, fitc–conjugated anti–ly-6c (gr1), fitc–conjugated anti-cd11c (bd-pharmingen bioscience, san  diego, ca). cells were sorted using a cell sorter. populations presenting >90% purity were used. sorted cells  were cytospined and stained with hoechst-33342 for nucleus. particle loaded cells were counted under  fluorescence microscope.  bm transplantation experiments.   gfp+ bm cells were obtained by flushing the femurs of adult cag-gfp mice and injected retroorbitally (1x107  cells per mouse) to 4-week-old c57bl/6 mice, as previously described [15]. recipient mice were irradiated at  9.0gy on day1 before transplantation, and were treated with 10mg/kg/day ciprofloxacin for 10 days. blood  chimaerism of >90% was controlled at 3–4 weeks post-transplantation.  statistical analyses.   all experimental values are presented as means and standard deviation except when indicated. statistical  analyses used unpaired student’s t-test (genotypes), p <0.05 was considered significant.  results  intramuscular alum-containing vaccine injection in mouse induces al deposition in distant tissues  alum-containing vaccine (36μl corresponding to 18μg al) was first injected in the tibialis anterior (ta) muscles  of c57bl6 mice. it induced an acute inflammatory reaction which stabilized after d4 in the form of collections of  typical alum-loaded mps with large hematoxylin+ and periodic acid schiff+ cytoplasm in muscle envelopes (fig.  1 a). in parallel, the local al tissue concentration determined by atomic absorption spectrometry decreased by  50% from injection to d4 and then remained stable until d21 (2342, 1122, and 1180 μg/g of dry muscle tissue, 


  khan et al.       12 respectively). al was additionally located in muscle and distant tissues by particle induced x-ray emission (pixe)  [19]. random scanning of 20μm thick sections, sampled and processed with careful protection against  environmental al, disclosed significant al signals in muscle, spleen and brain (fig. 1 b-c). in brain, al spots  accounted for 38, 21, and 37 % of 500x500μm tested fields at d21, month 6 and 12 (mo6 and mo12) post- injection, respectively (mean=31.5%; n=73 fields, fig. 1 d). the dip at month 6, was either due to interindividual  variations in aluminium handling or to sampling problems related to variable proportions of grey and white  matter in the randomly scanned areas (see below). the spot size ranged from about 1 to 14μm. by comparison,  5 unvaccinated mice showed only 7 positive out of 94 tested fields (mean=7.4%). these results confirmed that  al derived from alum can be translocated to, penetrate and persist in brain tissue [21,22,23]. al depots  detected in spleen and brain could have resulted from either physical translocation of alum particles, or in situ  aggregation of soluble al, or both.  fluorospheres injected into mouse muscle undergo lymphatic and systemic biodistribution  to examine if particles translocate to distant sites, we next injected polychromatic fluorescent latex beads  (flbs). a size of 500nm was chosen as an approximate of the average size of alum agglomerates observed in  vivo, allowing flb visualization as individual spheres by confocal and fluorescence microscopes (resolution >  200nm). after i.m. injection of 20μl suspensions, flbs transiently peaked in free form in blood (1200+400 flbs  per 100μl) at h1. as early as 1h post-injection, some flbs had also reached dlns. i.m. injection of gfp+cd45+  cells, either pre-loaded with flbs or coinjected with flbs, showed no gfp+ cells translocation to dlns at h1  (data not shown), indicating early cell-independent particle translocation to dlns by lymphatic drainage of the  muscle interstitial fluid [24]. in dlns, however, most flbs were cell-associated suggesting rapid capture by dln  resident cells. within 24h, flbs were phagocytozed by muscle cd11b+ mo/mps. phagocytes progressively  cleared the particles away from the interstitium to form collections (fig. 2a), mainly located in muscle  envelopes at d4.  at d4, flbs had dramatically increased in dlns, forming intracellular agglomerates in interfollicular area (fig. 2  b-e). particle-loaded cells extracted from dlns at d4 were cd45+, cd11b+, and more often gr1+/ly6c+ (69- 81%), and cd11c+, with either intermediate (46%) or high (22%) intensity (fig. 2a,c,d), thus corresponding to  mo-derived inflammatoty dcs and mps [25]. co-injection of flbs with the synthetic prostaglandin analog  bw245c, a compound known to inhibit dc migration [20], inhibited flb translocation to dlns at d4, by 32% in  the popliteal and 69% in inguinal dlns, respectively (fig. 2f). this indicated prominent particle transport within 


  khan et al.       13 phagocytic cells, at least downstream to popliteal dln. at later time points, both the number of particle-loaded  cells and the individual cell load markedly decreased in dlns (fig. 2e). while decreasing in dlns, flbs  dramatically increased in spleen from d4 to d21 (fig. 3 a,b). as spleen is unplugged to lymphatic vessels, the  particle transfer from dlns to spleen implicated exit from the lymphatic system through the thoracic duct and  circulation in the blood stream. consistently, smears showed similar d21 peak of flb-loaded cd11b+cells in the  circulation (fig. 3 c,d). from d4, circulating flbs were cell-associated (fig. 3 d). most flb-loaded cells in blood,  dlns and spleen exhibited a few particles and were gr1+/ly6c+ (fig 3 ef). however, 22-33% were gr1-/ly6c- in  spleen and had frequently incorporated >5flbs, suggesting phagocytosis-associated maturation of  inflammatory mo-derived cells [20,25,26]. flb-loaded cells had markedly decreased in spleen at d90. although  declining after d21, flb-loaded cells were still detected in blood at d45 and d90.  fluorosphere incorporation into brain is delayed and depends on prior cell loading in peripheral and  lymphoid tissues  particles were detected in brain mainly from d21 post-injection. after d21 post-i.m. injection, flbs gradually  increased in brain until the d90 endpoint in the c57bl6 mouse (fig. 4 a,b) and until the d180 endpoint in the  cx3cr1gfp/+ mouse conventionally used to study resident microglia (fig. 4 a, 5a). flbs were predominantly  found in the grey matter (82-95%), regardless of the amount of injected flbs (4, 10, 20μl), vaccine co-injection  (36μl), or post-injection time from d21 to d365. some flbs were detected in leptomeninges (9%) and in the  white matter (9%) at d21, but these locations became rare at later time points. flbs were <5% in choroid  plexus (table1). comparative flb distribution at mo3, mo6 and mo12 showed no prominent accumulations of  particles at any neuroanatomical location (fig. 4c). flbs were usually detected in brain as single particles  located within or at the surface of cells; 37-62% of particles could be reliably assigned to a given cell subset by  immunohistochemical screening. at d21, particles were mainly associated with perivascular cd11b+ mps, but at  d90 they were also found in deep ramified cx3cr1+microglia (fig. 5 a). particles were also detected in gfap+  astrocytes, map2+ or neurotrace-stained neurons, and vimentin+ leptomeningeal cells (fig. 5 b-e), and in ng2+  oligodendroglial progenitors/pericytes (not shown). flb incorporation into gfp+ resident ramified microglia of  cx3cr1gfp/+ mice increased by up to 26-fold the d21 value at d180.  importantly, compared to i.m. injection, the same flb amount injected in the tail vein resulted in virtually no  cerebral entry at d21 and d90 in c57bl6 mice (fig. 6 a). moreover, ablation of popliteal and inguinal dlns 


  khan et al.       14 before flb injection in ta muscle resulted in 60-80% reduction of flb incorporation into blood, spleen and  brain compartments at d21 (fig. 6 b). thus, cell uptake in muscle and dlns, and subsequent cell traffic to blood  crucially contributed to delayed particle translocation to spleen and brain (fig. 6 a-f). consistently, by injecting  flbs into muscle of gfp+bone marrow (bm) chimaeric mice obtained by transplanting gfp+bm-derived cells to  irradiated syngenic c56bl6 mice [15], we detected flb-loaded gfp+cells in these organs (fig. 7 a,b,c), and  observed delayed incorporation of donor-derived cells in brain (fig. 7 d,e).  this bm transplantation model is known to be associated with irradiation-induced blood-brain barrier (bbb)  alteration. dystrophin-deficient mdx mice also have chronically altered bbb [27]. as a corollary, compared to  age-matched controls, they show significantly more cd31+ brain capillaries, and dramatic increase of  perivascular cd11b+ macrophages (fig. 6c) at the expense of deep ramified microglia. flb injection in mdx  mouse muscle resulted in increased brain incorporation of particles at both d21 and d90, as assessed by both  histology and cytospins of cd45+/cd11b+cells extracted from brain (fig. 6 d,e,f). thus, bbb alteration and/or  the associated inflammatory/angiogenic response likely favours brain incorporation of circulating particle- loaded cells.  fluorescent nanohybrids coated with al(oh)3 undergo ccl2-dependent systemic scattering and brain  penetration  for confirmatory experiments we constructed fluorescent particles mimicking alum. rhodamine nanohybrids  [28] were covalently coated with a al(oh)3 shell. as assessed by the morin stain for alumimium, these al-rho  particles were avidly phagocytozed after i.m. injection and formed intracellular agglomerates similar in size to  the vaccine adjuvant (fig. 8 a,b). biodistribution of the alum fluorescent surrogate injected into ta muscle was  strikingly similar to that of flb (table 2), including d4 peak in dlns, d21 peak in spleen, delayed entry in brain,  and main association with gr1+/ly6c+ mos in tissues (fig. 8 c-h). compared to i.m. injection, subcutaneous  injection of al-rho particles was associated with even higher rate of diffusion to dlns (fig. 8 f), a finding  consistent with the presence of abundant migratory dcs in skin.  on the grounds of the human snp study, we performed ccl2 gain and loss of function experiments to  investigate the role of ccl2-responsive cells in particle scattering and neurodelivery. injection of al-rho  particles into the ta muscle of ccl2-deficient mice decreased particle incorporation by 35% into popliteal dln  and by 76% in inguinal dln at d4, and by 71%, 85% and 82% in spleen, blood, and brain, respectively, at d21  (fig. 9 a). conversely, al-rho particle biodistribution increased in different gain of ccl2 function experiments 


  khan et al.       15 (fig. 9 b-d). i.m. co-injection of al-rho with murine recombinant ccl2 (rccl2: 1μg) increased particle  incorporation by 47% into popliteal and 163% into inguinal dln (d4), and by 180% in spleen, 274% in blood,  and 341% in brain (d21).  morever, slow intracerebral (i.c.) infusion of ccl2 by an osmotic pump (180 pg/day during 15 days starting at  d7 after al-rho i.m. injection) increased by 74% particle incorporation into brain at d21 compared to pbs  control. combination of i.m. injection and i.c. infusion of rccl2 increased particle incorporation into brain by  539%. despite important interindividual variations, a consistent trend of ccl2-dependent increase of al brain  levels was detected 21 days after i.m. injection of 40μl of alum-containing vaccine (fig. 9 e). taken together  these results indicate that after i.m. injection, particles associated with inflammatory mos can enter the brain  using a ccl2-dependent mechanism, possibly through a trojan horse mechanism. importantly, al-rho particles  gaining access to the brain after i.m. injection remained intact since they were still coated with al(oh)3 as  assessed by both morin stain (fig. 10 a), and pixe (fig. 10 b). their incorporation in neural cells was consistently  associated with expression of il-1β (fig.10 c), a reliable marker of particle-induced nalp3 inflammasome  activation [29].  fluorescent nanohybrids coated with al(oh)3 are retained in brain  an apparently irreversible accumulation of nanomaterials after i.m. injection was unique to brain tissue which  lacks conventional lymphatic pathways and may retain immune cells [30]. we stereotactically injected 0.5μl al- rho in the striatum of c57bl6 mice, and counted particles in cervical lns, blood, and spleen at d4 and d21.  compared to the same amount of al-rho injected in the ta muscle, i.c. injection was associated with almost no  particle translocation to regional dlns (fig. 10 d), and appearance of 8-fold less particles in spleen (fig. 10 e).  since 25 free al-rho particles per 100μl were detected in blood at h1, it is likely that the rare particles  subsequently detected in spleen reflected direct particle passage into blood during i.c. injection. it seems  therefore that lack of recirculation likely contributed to progressive cerebral particle accumulation.  discussion  particles injected by the i.m. or s.c. route gained access to distant tissues. latex and al-rho particles showed  closely similar biodistribution, suggesting a shared basic scattering mechanism. initial cell uptake in peripheral  and dln tissues and subsequent transport within inflammatory mo-derived cells was critically involved, as  indicated by immunophenotyping, cell migration blockade and dln ablation. cells were heavily loaded with  particles soon after i.m. injection but usually contained only 1–2 particles after d4 and downstream the 


  khan et al.       16 popliteal dln, pointing to either dilution by cell division [31] or particle dispatching to other cells [32] within  dlns. previous studies have reported particle cell transport from skin to dlns [25] but downstream particle  fate remained largely unexplored [33]. there is strong evidence that, in inflammatory conditions, all dcs  reaching dlns do not die locally but may rather gain access to the blood through efferent lymphatics and the  thoracic duct, and present antigens in spleen and bone marrow [33]. ingested adjuvant particles boost this  phenomenon which in turn likely favours their translocation from the injection point to distant sites as: (i) alum  induces rapid differenciation of monocyte-lineage cells into apcs [34], and stimulates their migration to dlns  [35], (ii) beryllium hydroxide, a closely similar particulate adjuvant, strongly stimulates dc egress through  efferent lymphatics [36], and, as shown herein, (iii) al deposits may be detected by pixe in spleen and brain  after i.m. injection of alum.  delayed and slowly progressive particle accumulation occurred in intact brains. experiments using the  parabiosis model [37] or avoiding brain irradiation prior to bm transplantation [38] have shown that  endogenous microglia are not replenished by the periphery under normal cns conditions. although low  chimerism inherent to these experimental approaches may lead to some underestimation of slow microglia  turnover from the periphery [39], a more likely explanation of our findings is that particles exert stimulatory  effects on myeloid cell trafficking [36]. both latex particles and aluminium hydroxide agglomerates promote  inflammation [40,41] and non-specific immune stimulation can increase by up to 20-fold monocyte  transendothelial migration in in vitro models of the bbb [42]. consistently, i.m. injection of rccl2 strongly  increased particle incorporation into intact brain while ccl2-deficient mice had decreased neurodelivery. rccl2  likely induced the exit of inflammatory mos and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bm [43],  followed by their transmigration to the injected muscle and to dlns [44], prior to particle loading and  dissemination. cerebral infusion of low doses of rccl2, mimicking pathologic states attracting inflammatory  monocytes, also increased particle neurodelivery. intracerebral particles translocated with time from  perivascular macrophages to the sentinel network of parenchymal microglia and to other resident neural cells,  and likely failed to recirculate, thus explaining their progressive cerebral accumulation.  conclusion.  taken together, our results indicate that, similarly to intracellular bacteria [45], nanomaterials can be  transported by mo-lineage cells to dlns, blood, and spleen, and, similarly to hiv [46] and other pathogens  [47], may use ccl2-dependent mo transmigration across the bbb to enter the brain. this occurs at extremely 


  khan et al.       17 low rate in normal mice, the percentage of injected particles found in tissues being estimated at 1:105 in d21  spleen and 1:107 in d90 brain, consistently with the excellent tolerance of almost all individuals to limited doses  of alum and other injected particles. neurodelivery of nanomaterials significantly increased in mice with either  weak bbb or high tissue levels of ccl2, as previously suspected for pathogens in humans [48]. on the one hand,  such a cerebral incorporation of nanomaterials injected into tissues should be regarded as an interesting  characteristic in the setting of therapeutic strategies targeting the cns. on the other hand alum has high  neurotoxic potential [49], and planning administration of continuously escalating doses of this poorly  biodegradable adjuvant in the population should be carefully evaluated by regulatory agencies since the  compound may be insidiously unsafe. it is likely that good tolerance to alum may be challenged by a variety of  factors including overimmunization, bbb immaturity, individual susceptibility factors, and ageing that may be  associated with both subtle bbb alterations and progressive increase of ccl2 production (50).
