2 abstract background intimate partner violence (ipv) against women is a global public health problem.  yet, data  on ipv against native american women are extremely limited.  we conducted a cross- sectional study of native american women to: determine prevalence of lifetime and past-year  ipv and partner injury; examine ipv in relation to pregnancy; and assess demographic and  socioeconomic correlates of past-year ipv.  methods participants were recruited from a tribally-operated clinic serving low-income pregnant and  childbearing women in southwest oklahoma.  a self-administered survey was completed by  312 native american women (96% response rate) attending the clinic from june through  august 1997.  lifetime and past-year ipv were measured using modified 18-item conflict  tactics scales.  a socioeconomic index was created based on partner’s education, public  assistance receipt, and poverty level.   results over half (58.7%; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 53.0, 64.1) of participants reported lifetime  physical and/or sexual ipv; 39.1% (ci: 33.7, 44.8) experienced severe physical ipv; 12.2%  (ci: 8.9, 16.5) reported partner-forced sexual activity; and 40.1% (ci: 34.6, 45.8) reported  lifetime partner-perpetrated injuries.  a total of 273 women had a spouse or boyfriend during  the previous 12 months.  although all participants were native american, 59.0% of partners  were non-native.  past-year prevalence was: 30.1% (ci: 24.7, 35.9) for physical and/or  sexual ipv; 15.8% (ci: 11.7, 20.7) for severe physical ipv; 3.3% (ci: 1.6, 6.4) for forced  partner-perpetrated sexual activity; and 16.4% (ci: 12.3, 21.5) for intimate partner injury.   reported ipv prevalence during pregnancy was 9.3% (ci: 5.2, 15.7).  pregnancy was not 


3 associated with past-year ipv (odds ratio [or]=0.9).  past-year ipv prevalence was 42.8%  among women scoring low on the socioeconomic index, compared with 10.1% among the  reference group.  after adjusting for age, relationship status, and household size, low  socioeconomic index remained strongly associated with past-year ipv (or=5.0, ci: 2.4,  10.7).   conclusions  native american women in our sample experienced exceptionally high rates of lifetime and  past-year ipv.  additionally, within this low-income sample, there was strong evidence of socioeconomic variability in ipv.  further research should determine prevalence of ipv  against native women from diverse tribes and regions, and examine pathways through which  socioeconomic disadvantage may increase their ipv risk. 


4 background  intimate partner violence (ipv) against women (defined as acts or threats of physical or  sexual assault perpetrated against women by their current or former spouses, intimate  partners, or dates) is a major public health problem in the united states.  a recent national  survey of 8,000 women found that 76% of all rapes and physical assaults against adult u.s.  women are perpetrated by a current or former husband, cohabiting partner, or date [1].  data  from this survey further indicate that 25 million (25%) u.s. women are physically and/or  sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime, and 1.5 million (1.5%) women  experience ipv annually [2].  other national family violence studies have produced even  higher estimates of ipv against u.s. women [3-5].   estimates of ipv during pregnancy range from 1% to 20%, with most studies reporting rates  of 4 to 8% [6-8].  a number of clinic- and hospital-based studies of pregnant women have  concluded that pregnancy may be associated with increased ipv risk [6-8].  however, these  studies assessed the association between pregnancy and ipv by asking pregnant women who  reported ipv whether the violence had changed during pregnancy; none of these studies had a  comparison population of non-pregnant women [7,8].   in contrast, large population-based  samples of pregnant and non-pregnant women have found no association between pregnancy  and ipv prevalence after controlling for age and socioeconomic factors [7].   health and medical consequences of ipv for women are substantial.  national data show that  41 to 51% of women who are physically assaulted by an intimate sustain injuries [2,9,10].   physical and sexual ipv against women was recently estimated to account for nearly 500,000  hospital emergency room visits and one million physician visits annually in the united states  [2].  further, numerous studies have found associations between ipv and physical and mental 


5 health outcomes in women, including various physical and chronic conditions [5,11,12], poor  self-rated health [5,13,14], anxiety and depression [5,11,13,15-18], suicidality [18], and post- traumatic stress disorder [11,13,15,18]. though women from all socioeconomic groups are assaulted by intimate partners, there is  considerable evidence that women from lower socioeconomic groups disproportionately  experience ipv [9,19-22].  for example, national crime victimization survey data show a  strong linear relationship between decreasing household income and increasing ipv against  women, with nearly a seven-fold ipv rate disparity for those with incomes below $7,500  compared with those earning at least $75,000 [9].  in addition, recent studies of low-income  women have found exceptionally high rates of lifetime and recent ipv, with homeless women  and women on public assistance demonstrating the highest victimization rates [13,20]. very little is known about the nature or extent of ipv against native american women, or  about the interrelationships between socioeconomic conditions and ipv in this culturally and  economically diverse population [23].  further, no published studies have compared ipv  prevalence among pregnant versus non-pregnant native american women.  after an  extensive review of several databases, we found nine published studies documenting the  prevalence of non-lethal ipv against native american women [2,15,24-29].  lifetime  prevalence of physical and/or sexual ipv in these studies ranged from 38 to 83%, whereas  past-year ipv rates varied from 3 to 48%.  the sampling frames, ipv measures, and methods  of survey administration varied widely across the studies.  in addition, only four studies of  native american women had sample sizes over 300 [26,29,30], only two (n#56) reported  prevalence of ipv during pregnancy [27,28], and only two examined socioeconomic factors  associated with past-year ipv [24,26].


6 many more studies are needed that investigate the extent and nature of ipv among diverse  samples of native american women.  our study was designed to address this need.  we  collected data from a relatively large sample of low-income native american women  attending a women-infant and children’s nutritional program (wic) clinic in oklahoma to:  a) determine the prevalence of lifetime and past-year ipv and intimate partner injury; b)  examine ipv prevalence in relation to pregnancy; and b) assess demographic and  socioeconomic correlates of past-year ipv.  methods study population this cross-sectional study recruited participants from a tribally-operated wic clinic in  southwest oklahoma.  the clinic provides nutrition counselling and vouchers for purchasing  specified foods (e.g., milk, juice, eggs, cheese, cereal, beans, tuna, and carrots) to low-income  (less than 185% of federal poverty level) women who are pregnant, lactating, or up to 6  months postpartum, and infants and children younger than five years of age.  all wic- eligible women, regardless of race/ethnicity or tribal affiliation, can obtain services at the  clinic.  however, the vast majority of wic clients are native women who are enrolled  members of tribes whose present-day land bases are located in southwestern and western  oklahoma.  eligible participants consisted of all native american women and emancipated  teens who visited the clinic from june through august 1997 to pick up food vouchers for  themselves and/or their children. a brief history of the settlement of tribes into oklahoma is warranted.  the united states has  a long sordid history of removal and relocation of native peoples.  by 1885, the u.s. 


7 government had re-settled over 30 culturally-diverse tribes, from the east, north, and south,  into present-day oklahoma, and comanche, kiowa, and apache reservations were  established in southwest oklahoma [31,32].  however, the general indian allotment act of  1887 began a process of sub-dividing tribal lands and dissolving agreements with tribal  governments [31].  by the early 1900’s, the reservation lands held by the comanche, kiowa,  and apache tribes had been dissolved by the jerome agreement and u.s. congressional  legislation [33,34].  adult tribal members were issued individual land allotments and  hundreds of thousands of acres of reservation land were re-assigned to oklahoma territory to  be settled by whites [33].  thus, today, there are no reservations in southwest oklahoma;  native americans (of diverse cultural and tribal histories) represent only 7% of all residents  in the most populated county in the region [35].  land titles to the original allotments are held  by many entities, including tribal governments, native american and non-native individuals  and groups, as well as the state and federal governments [36]. data collection the study protocol was approved by the pertinent tribal board and by the institutional review  boards of the university of oklahoma health sciences center and of the oklahoma area and  headquarters indian health service.  data were collected via a self-administered survey.   after obtaining their food vouchers, each eligible woman was directed by clinic staff to a  trained study assistant located in a private office inside the clinic.  the assistant then privately  obtained informed consent from participants, assisted those who had difficulty filling out the  survey, assured data confidentiality, and offered participants information on local counselling  and family services.  participants completed the surveys in 15-20 minutes and were paid $12  cash for participation.  a total of 312 women participated, representing 96% of all eligible  women.


8 outcome measures  intimate partner violence was measured using a modified 18-item version of the original  conflict tactics scales (cts) [37].  the cts assessed verbal and psychological aggression,  and physical and sexual assault.  aggression items asked women whether a partner ‘insulted  or swore at her’, ‘did or said something to hurt her’, ‘threatened to hit or throw something at  her’, or ‘threw, smashed, hit, or kicked something’.  physical assault items were divided into  minor or severe as defined by straus [38].  minor assault items included whether a boyfriend  or husband ‘threw something at her’, ‘pushed, grabbed, or shoved her’, or ‘slapped her’.   severe assault items assessed whether a partner ‘kicked, bit, or hit her with a fist’, ‘hit or tried  to hit her with something’, ‘choked her’, ‘beat her up’, ‘threatened her with a knife or gun’,  or ‘used a knife or fired a gun’.  sexual assault was evaluated with a single question that  asked whether a partner had ‘forced her into sexual activity’.    the survey inquired separately about lifetime and past-year ipv.  for lifetime ipv, women  were asked to think about all of their relationships with men in their lifetime.  past-year ipv  was only asked of women who reported having a boyfriend or being married during the past  12 months.  for each time frame, women indicated whether (yes or no) a boyfriend or  husband had done each act listed.  women who reported lifetime or past-year ipv also  marked, for each time frame, which body parts, if any, had been injured by an intimate  partner.  the standard cts introduction [37] was used only for the lifetime questions. two survey questions inquired about ipv during pregnancy for women who reported being  pregnant during the past 12 months.  women were asked, “during your most recent  pregnancy did your husband/boyfriend physically or sexually assault or hurt you?” and, if  yes, whether “the level or amount of violence was worse than before you got pregnant”.  


9 socioeconomic and demographic measures socioeconomic and demographic information was collected for individuals and the  household.  each woman reported her own and her current partner’s educational attainment,  past-year employment status, and age.  household data included receipt of food stamps,  temporary assistance to needy families (tanf) or welfare in the past 12 months, as well as  current household size, current monthly household income, and number of adults and  children supported by this income.  percent of the 1997 federal poverty level was computed  from income data [39].  women also specified their relationship status, length of current  relationship, partner’s race/ethnicity, and whether there was a working telephone in her  home.   we also collected data on tribal affiliations of respondents and their partners (if their partners  were native american).  however, because this study was not designed to provide an  accurate estimate of ipv prevalence among any particular tribe, we agreed not to publish  tribe-specific data, in accordance with the desires of local tribal governments.  statistical analyses survey data were entered into an access database and validated.  sas was used for analyses  [40].  we computed lifetime and past-year prevalence of ipv and intimate partner injury by  type and severity.  the main study outcome, past-year physical and/or sexual ipv, was binary  (yes vs. no).  women who reported no past-year physical or sexual ipv comprised the control  group.  for continuous measures, quartiles were created based on the distribution among  controls.  to ensure adequate cell sizes for analyses, the bottom (e.g., household size) or top  (e.g., poverty level) three quartiles were combined to form the reference group.  we  calculated unadjusted prevalence ratios (prs) and odds ratios (ors), as well as their  associated 95% confidence intervals (cis) to estimate the magnitude of univariate 


10 associations between socioeconomic and demographic variables and past-year ipv.  because  past-year ipv was highly prevalent, the ors tend to substantially overestimate the prs [41].   however, the ors accurately depict disparities in the odds of past-year ipv for different risk  groups [42], and were useful for assessing interactions among study variables in stratified  analyses via the breslow-day test for homogeneity of the ors.  to investigate which  sociodemographic measures were independently associated with past-year ipv, we developed  a final logistic regression model using non-automated backward and stepwise modeling  techniques; only those variables with p-values <0.05 were kept in the final model. results  selected socio-demographic characteristics of study participants and their male partners are  presented in table 1.  participants ranged in age from 14 to 48 years (0=26.2).  at the time of  the survey, 74.1% of women had a spouse or steady male partner and the majority (69.8%)  had been in their relationship for over two years.  a total of 58% of participants were  pregnant sometime during the year prior to the survey.  while all women were native  american, most (59.0%) of their partners were not.  a total of 62% of women were enrolled  with one of two local tribes and the remainder belonged to 27 different tribes, nearly all based  in oklahoma.  likewise the 41% of partners who were native american were primarily  (69%) affiliated with two local tribes and the remainder belonged to numerous oklahoma  tribes.   approximately 30% of women and their partners had not attained a high school degree and  less than 5% were college graduates.  in the year prior to the survey, 49.4% of women and  18.0% of partners were unemployed, 22.4% of families received tanf or welfare, and  42.6% of families received food stamps.  the majority of employed partners worked as 


11 skilled laborers.  nearly three-quarters (73.4%) of women lived at or below the federal  poverty level and 30.1% lived in severe poverty (#50% of federal poverty level).  in addition,  over one-third (35.7%) of women did not have a working telephone in their home. prevalence of ipv over half (58.7%; 95% ci: 53.0, 64.1) of study women reported experiencing physical or  sexual ipv in their lifetime and 39.1% (95% ci: 33.7, 44.8) experienced severe acts of  physical partner-perpetrated violence (table 2).  common forms of severe physical assault  included being kicked, bit, or hit with a fist (28.2%); being choked (21.2%); and beat up  (19.6%).  nearly 1 in 9 women had been threatened with a knife or gun by a partner.  a total  of 40.1% (95% ci: 34.6, 45.8) of all women reported lifetime partner-perpetrated injuries and  31.1% reported partner-perpetrated injuries to their neck, head, or face (table 2). lifetime prevalence of forced sexual activity by a partner was 12.2% (95% ci: 8.9, 16.5).   only one woman reported sexual ipv but no physical ipv, and most (84%) women who were  sexually assaulted by a partner also reported multiple forms of severe physical ipv.  the  lifetime prevalence of sexual ipv was far lower among women experiencing no (0.8%) or  only minor (5.3%) physical ipv, in contrast to the sexual ipv prevalence (27.9%) among  women reporting severe lifetime physical ipv.   there were 273 (88%) women who reported having a spouse or boyfriend during the  previous 12 months.  thirty percent (95% ci: 24.7, 35.9) of these women reported  experiencing some form of physical or sexual ipv in the past year, 15.8% (95% ci: 11.7,  20.7) reported severe physical ipv, and 16.4% (95% ci: 12.3, 21.5) reported partner- perpetrated injuries (table 2).  the past-year prevalence of sexual ipv was 3.3% (95% ci:  1.6, 6.4).  all women (n=9) who reported past-year sexual ipv also reported past-year 


12 physical ipv.  among women reporting past-year physical ipv, 11.0% (95% ci: 5.5, 20.3)  also reported partner-forced sexual activity.  ipv during pregnancy among women who were pregnant in the past year, 140 (87%) answered survey questions on  ipv during pregnancy.  a total of 13 (9.3%; 95% ci: 5.2, 15.7) of these women reported that  their partner physically or sexually assaulted or hurt them during their pregnancy.  among  the women reporting ipv during pregnancy, 4 (30.8%; 95% ci: 10.4, 61.1) reported that the  level or amount of violence was worse than before they got pregnant. univariate analyses socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with past-year ipv in univariate analyses  included participant’s age less than 32 years (pr=1.9; 95% ci: 1.0, 3.5); being divorced or  separated (pr=2.3; 95% ci: 1.6, 3.2); having six or more persons in the household (pr=1.6;  95% ci: 1.1, 2.3); being on public assistance (pr=2.1; 95% ci: 1.4, 3.0); and living in  extreme poverty (pr=1.6; 95% ci: 1.1, 2.2) (table 3).  partner’s education and employment  were much more strongly associated with past-year ipv than were participant’s education  and employment (table 3).  past-year ipv prevalence was 49.4% for women with partners  who had not graduated from high school compared with 20.2% for women with partners who  were high school graduates (pr=2.4; 95% ci: 1.7, 3.5).   among women with unemployed  partners, 40.8% reported past-year ipv in contrast to 25.9% of women with partners who  were employed or full-time students (pr=1.6; 95% ci: 1.0, 2.4).   we also examined two status inconsistency variables (data not shown).  status inconsistency  based on employment (i.e., participant’s employment status in relation to her partner’s  employment) was not significantly associated with past-year ipv (p=0.175), but status 


13 inconsistency based on education showed a strong univariate association (p<0.001).  past- year ipv prevalence was 25.8% (95% ci: 12.5, 44.9) for women in relationships where their  education status was worse than their partner’s (i.e., partner was high school graduate but  participant was not), 23.3% (95% ci: 17.4, 30.4) for women with education equal to their  partner’s, and 54.8% (95% ci: 38.8, 69.8) for women in relationships where they had  graduated high school but their partner had not.  however, further analyses revealed that the  latter rate was statistically similar to the ipv prevalence for women in relationships where  neither partner had a high school degree (41.2%; 95% ci: 25.1, 59.2), indicating that  variability in past-year ipv was affected by partner’s education, rather than status  inconsistency. other factors examined in relation to past-year ipv included partner’s race/ethnicity,  pregnancy, and lack of a home telephone (table 3).  there was some variability in past-year  ipv by partner’s race/ethnicity (p=0.101).  past-year ipv rates among women with native  american (33.0%) or african american (42.9%) partners were higher than among women  with white (21.4%) or hispanic (25.0%) partners.  there was no association between being  pregnant in the past 12 months and past-year ipv (pr=0.9; 95% ci: 0.6, 1.3).  likewise,  there was no association between lack of a residential telephone and past-year ipv (or=1.1),  although it should be noted that 41% of women who experienced past-year ipv did not have  a home telephone. statistical interactions we attempted to examine interactions between partner’s race/ethnicity and socioeconomic  conditions.  there was no evidence of additive or multiplicative interactions between the  combined socioeconomic index and partner’s race/ethnicity, although these analyses were  limited by small cell sizes.


14 socioeconomic measures demonstrating significant (p<0.05) interactions with past-year ipv  are shown in table 4.  a strong interaction was observed between public assistance and  partner’s education (p=0.007).  among women not on public assistance, the past-year ipv  rate was 50.0% in women with partners who had not graduated from high school compared  with 11.1% in women with partners who had at least a high school degree (or=8.0; 95% ci:  3.3, 19.1).  in contrast, among public assistance recipients, there was only a nominal  association between partner’s education and ipv (or=1.7; 95% ci: 0.8, 3.6).  similar  interactions were observed between public assistance and poverty level (p=0.028), and  between poverty level and partner’s education (p=0.035). the interactions among socioeconomic variables each followed a pattern suggestive of a  threshold effect (table 4).  by far the lowest ipv rates occurred in strata with the least dire  socioeconomic conditions, whereas women who experienced one or two severe  socioeconomic conditions had similarly increased ipv.  for example, the ipv prevalence was  18.1% for women who lived above 50% of the federal poverty level and did not receive  public assistance, whereas the ipv prevalence was 44.4% for women with similar household  income but who received public assistance, 42.1% for women in severe poverty but not on  public assistance, and 39.7% for women in severe poverty and on public assistance. because all three socioeconomic measures shown in table 4 each had significant two-way  interactions with the other two socioeconomic variables (e.g., poverty level interacted with  both partner’s education and public assistance), we created a socioeconomic index based on  these three variables to explore a three-way interaction and examine whether ipv prevalence  increased as the number of poor socioeconomic conditions increased.  each variable 


15 (partner’s education: <high school graduate (hsg) v. $hsg; public assistance: yes v. no; and  percent of federal poverty level: #50% v. >50%) was coded as 0 or 1 and then summed.  the  ipv rates associated with scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 10.1%, 37.5%, 51.9%, and 36.0%,  respectively.  due to limited cell sizes and no evidence of a clear trend, scores of 1 through 3  were combined for multivariate analyses.  thus, women categorized in the low  socioeconomic group based on any one of the three measures were compared with those  categorized in the reference group for all three socioeconomic measures.  as shown in table  3, 42.8% of women scoring low on the combined socioeconomic index were assaulted by a  partner in the past year compared with 10.1% of women in the reference group (pr=4.2; 95%  ci: 2.3, 7.8). multivariate analyses results of the final logistic regression model of past-year ipv are shown in table 3.  the  combined socioeconomic index was most strongly associated with past-year ipv prevalence  (or=5.0; 95% ci: 2.4, 10.7).  other important factors were: being divorced or separated  (or=3.9; 95% ci: 2.0, 7.5); participant’s age less than 32 years (or=3.2; 95% ci: 1.3, 7.6);  and having 6 or more persons in the household (or=2.3; 95% ci: 1.2, 4.6).  partner’s  race/ethnicity, participant’s education, and employment variables were not significant when  added to the final model.  after controlling for the combined socioeconomic index, there was  no association between partner’s employment and past-year ipv (adjusted or=1.3; 95% ci:  0.7, 2.6).  likewise, there was no increased ipv prevalence associated with african  american (adjusted or=1.3; 95% ci: 0.5, 3.3) or native american partners (adjusted  or=1.4; 95% ci: 0.7, 2.8) after controlling for the combined socioeconomic index and  having 6 or more persons in the household. discussion


16 this study is one of only a few published investigations to examine prevalence and  socioeconomic correlates of ipv in a relatively large sample of native american women.  in  addition, our study is the first to examine pregnancy status in relation to ipv among native  american women.  our findings indicate that low-income reproductive age native women in  southwest oklahoma have exceptionally high lifetime and past-year ipv rates.  further, our  results show that past-year ipv is not associated with pregnancy in this sample, but that ipv  is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage. lifetime ipv prevalence during their lifetime, nearly 60% of study women reported experiencing physical and/or  sexual ipv, 39% had been severely assaulted by a partner, 1 in 5 had been beaten up, 40%  had resulting injuries, and 12% had been forced into sexual activity by a partner.  these  lifetime rates are approximately double those observed in the national violence against  women survey, which found that 7.7% of all u.s. women are raped by an intimate partner  and 24.8% experience partner-perpetrated physical and/or sexual ipv in their lifetime [2].   likewise, our lifetime physical ipv rate (58%) is about twice the prevalence (30%) reported  in a statewide telephone survey of 3,130 georgia women aged 15-44 years [43] and nearly  double the prevalence (37%) of lifetime emotional or physical ipv reported in a large study  of over 1,600 women aged 18-39 attending community hospital emergency departments in  pennsylvania and california [44].  additionally, our lifetime physical ipv prevalence is a  third higher than that (45%) reported for california public hospital primary care patients aged  18 –29 years [45], and far higher than lifetime rates (11-23%) observed in several studies of  women attending public prenatal clinics [8]. only a handful of studies have assessed lifetime ipv against native american women  [2,15,26,28,30].  available data indicate wide variability in ipv rates among different 


17 samples of native women.  the rate of lifetime physical ipv observed in our study is 1.4 to  1.9 times higher than rates reported for a national telephone sample of native american  women [2] and for native women attending health clinics located on the navajo reservation  [26], but our rate is considerably lower than those (>75%) reported for three other  populations of native american women [15,28,30].  three previous studies reported lifetime  prevalence of sexual ipv against native women.  the rate (12.2%) of sexual ipv observed in  our study population is similar to two of these studies [2,26], but half the rate found among  low-income native women in western oklahoma [30].  the only two previous studies that  examined non-lethal intimate partner injury among native american women found  substantially higher lifetime rates (62-73%) than we observed [15,30]. findings from studies of marital rape indicate that most women who experience sexual ipv  also report physical abuse by their partner [46,47].  our data support these findings.  we  found that all but one woman who experienced partner-forced sexual activity in their lifetime  also reported physical ipv, with the vast majority (84%) reporting two or more types of  severe physical assault.  further, studies based on convenience samples of battered women  have found that the prevalence of sexual ipv among battered women ranges from 26% to  70% [46-49].  our results were at low-end of this range, indicating a lifetime sexual ipv  prevalence of 28% among women who reported severe lifetime physical ipv.  variability in  findings across studies may be due to differences in sample recruitment and in measures used  to assess physical and sexual ipv. ipv during pregnancy although case studies of pregnant women have suggested that pregnancy is a time of  increased ipv risk, studies using national probability samples have consistently found no  association between ipv and pregnancy [6,7].  similar to these latter studies, we found no 


18 difference in past-year ipv prevalence for pregnant compared with non-pregnant women.   likewise, the observed rate (9%) of ipv during pregnancy for our sample of native women  is consistent with rates (4-8%) reported in the literature [6-8], yet it is considerably lower  than the prevalence (33%) observed among 30 native american women attending an urban  indian clinic in the midwestern united states [27].  there are important limitations of our  data on ipv during pregnancy.  unlike our ipv assessments for lifetime and past-year time  periods, which utilized multiple questions on specific assaultive acts (e.g., being choked),  ipv during pregnancy was assessed with a single summary question (see methods) and thus  may have resulted in underreporting.  further, our survey did not include questions on ipv  during specific time periods before and during pregnancy as recommended by ballard et al  [50], so we could not determine the percentage of pregnant women for whom ipv began,  continued, or ceased during their pregnancy. past-year ipv prevalence we found that 30% of native american participants experienced physical assault by a partner  in the year prior to the survey, with over half of these women reporting resulting injuries.   these past-year ipv rates are much higher than population-based national and statewide  estimates for reproductive age u.s. women, which range from less than 1% to 17%  [6,9,43,51-53].  further, our findings are three times the rate (10%) of past-year physical ipv  found among young (18-29 years) women attending public clinics in san francisco [45] and  among women attending wic clinics in minnesota [54], and approximately twice the  prevalence (14%) found among california women enrolled in wic clinics [55]. to our knowledge, only four previous studies assessed prevalence of past-year ipv among  native american women [15,24,26,29].  our past-year physical and/or sexual ipv prevalence  estimate is 10 times higher than the 3% rate reported for a random telephone survey of 588 


19 native american women living on or near montana reservations, over two times higher than  the physical ipv rates found among navajo women and among a national telephone sample  of native american women [24,26], but substantially lower than the past-year prevalence  (48%) reported for san carlos apache women [15].  our estimate of past-year sexual ipv is  nearly identical to the only other rate (3.8%) reported in the literature for native american  women [26]. variability in ipv rates overall, findings from existing studies of lifetime and past-year ipv among native american  women, while limited, suggest wide variability in ipv rates across samples.  these studies  were conducted among diverse samples of native women, including those living on  reservations in the southwest (e.g., san carlos apache, navajo) and montana, non- reservation rural native women in western oklahoma, and a population-based telephone  sample of u.s. native american women.  the observed variability in ipv prevalence among  these samples could be due to major differences across tribes in stressful socioeconomic  conditions, risk and protective factors, traditional and present-day cultural beliefs and  practices, and gender norms [23].  however, there are substantial methodologic differences  among these studies in terms of sampling frames, survey administration, and survey  instruments, all of which could also explain the variability in study findings.  for example,  those studies demonstrating the highest ipv rates contained samples of relatively young, very  low-income women and utilized in-person interviews with ipv measures based on multiple  questions from the conflict tactics scales [15,28,30].  in contrast, studies with the lowest  rates were population-based telephone surveys of native women of all ages and incomes, one  of which utilized a single screening question to assess ipv [2,29].  in general, the ipv rates  observed in our study were between these two extremes.  although our sample was limited to  reproductive age, low-income women who have been found to have the highest ipv rates, we 


20 utilized a self-administered survey, which may have resulted in less ipv disclosure than  studies utilizing in-person interviews.  thus, it is difficult to determine whether the variability  in ipv rates observed across samples is due to methodologic differences in study protocols or  to true differences among the populations studied.  further research is needed to determine  ipv prevalence among diverse samples of native women.  such research should assess  lifetime and past-year physical and sexual ipv; utilize multiple questions to assess ipv;  include samples that are representative of particular tribes or groups of native women; and  study sufficiently large samples of native women to provide relatively precise rate estimates. social context of ipv against native women despite the variability in ipv rates observed among studies of native american women,  findings suggest that, across tribes, native women experience up to two or three times more  ipv than u.s. women in general. many scholars contend that western imperialism, and its  concomitant devaluation, exploitation, and abuse of native peoples and native women, are  largely responsible for the present day problem of violence against native american women  [56-58].  native peoples in the u.s. have been subject to a long, brutal history of colonization  by the u.s. government, resulting in massive loss of lands and resources, and in severe  disruption of traditional gender roles and family structures [56-59].  one legacy of this  colonization is that native americans have the highest poverty rate (24.5%) of all  racial/ethnic groups in the united states [60].  although there is wide variability in poverty  rates among tribes [61], in our study county in oklahoma, 27.8% of native american  families lived in poverty in 1999 compared with 9.4% of white families [62].  likewise,  employment opportunities for native americans are more limited than for many other racial  groups.  for example, the unemployment rate for native men (12.0%) in our study county  was nearly triple that for white men (4.2%) [62]. 


21 the severely depressed socioeconomic conditions under which a disproportionate percentage  of native american families live may explain their higher ipv rates.  although no study has  directly tested this hypothesis by examining ipv rates for native americans compared with  other racial groups after controlling for socioeconomic conditions, our findings indirectly  support this hypothesis.  first, the ipv prevalence rates observed in our study are comparable  to those reported for other samples of low- and severely low-income women [20].  second,  we found wide socioeconomic variability in past-year ipv within our sample of low-income  native women.  low-income native women with the “best” socioeconomic circumstances  (i.e., not on public assistance, above 50% of federal poverty level, and partner was high  school graduate) had a past-year ipv prevalence (10.1%) that was one fourth that of native  women living under more severe socioeconomic conditions (42.8%).  the 10% ipv  prevalence rate we observed among the least socioeconomically disadvantaged low-income  native women is within the range of past-year rates reported in other clinic and population- based samples of reproductive age women [8,43,45,53].   to our knowledge, this study is the first to examine interactions among various  socioeconomic measures and ipv against low-income women.  we found significant two- way interactions between public assistance receipt and partner’s education; public assistance  and poverty level; and poverty level and partner’s education.  because further exploration of  these interactions was limited by small cell sizes, we developed a socioeconomic index based  on these three variables and assessed whether the prevalence of past-year ipv against native  american women increased as the number of poor socioeconomic conditions increased.   unexpectedly, we did not observe any dose-response relations.  instead, our results suggested  a threshold effect: women who experienced one or more sources of socioeconomic  disadvantage had similarly high past-year ipv rates, whereas low-income women who had no 


22 additional poor socioeconomic measures had a much lower ipv prevalence.  our finding that  low-income native women with the “best” socioeconomic circumstances had a relatively low  past-year ipv rate (10.1%) further suggests that being low-income, by itself, may not be a  sufficient condition for increased ipv risk.  this low-risk subgroup represented about one  third of our low-income study sample.  the remaining two-thirds of the sample who  experienced at least one additional source of socioeconomic disadvantage had extremely high  past-year ipv rates (42.8%).   although not directly comparable to our study findings, other studies of low-income  populations have observed similar socioeconomic variability in past-year ipv [13,20,26].   for example, fairchild’s and colleagues’ study of relatively low-income navajo women  found that living in a household receiving governmental financial assistance was associated  with a 2.3 fold increased odds of past-year ipv [26].  likewise, tolman and rosen found that  welfare recipients who experienced severe economic hardships such as eviction, food  insufficiency, or homelessness, had rates of past-year severe ipv that were two to three times  higher than welfare recipients without these hardships.  the mechanisms through which  concentrated socioeconomic disadvantage may be associated with ipv against low-income  women needs further investigation. welfare reform and ipv against native women  in 1996 president clinton signed the personal responsibility and work opportunity  reconciliation act (prwora), which established work requirements and strict time limits  on federal welfare assistance [63].  since passage of this legislation, several studies have  examined the impact of ipv on welfare recipients [20,64].  current research indicates that:  welfare recipients have far higher ipv rates than the general population; abusers directly  prevent many welfare recipients from working; and that ipv indirectly interferes with 


23 women’s ability to transition from welfare to work by increasing mental and physical health  problems [20,64].  the fairchild et al study [26] and our study are the only investigations to  examine public assistance in relation to past-year ipv among native women.  both studies  found that within low-income samples of native american women, those on public  assistance had approximately double the ipv rate of native women not on public assistance.   our results showed that nearly half of our sample had received public assistance in the 12  months prior to the survey and that 42% of women on public assistance experienced past-year  physical and/or sexual ipv.  these findings suggest that a high percentage of native women  receiving welfare assistance need ipv-related services and many may have difficulty  conforming to federal tanf work requirements.  compounding this problem, in oklahoma  as elsewhere, most women who are experiencing ipv do not disclose this information to welfare caseworkers (personal communication, peggy butcher, oklahoma department of  human services, november 2002) [64,65].  state welfare programs serving native american  women and children may improve ipv disclosure rates by working with tribal wic programs  or primary care providers at indian health service and tribal medical facilities to implement  universal screening and referrals for ipv. study limitations our study should be interpreted in light of its limitations.  first, our ipv measures were based  on self-report and thus were subject to recall and reporting bias.  however, ipv estimates  from self-report data are generally considered less biased than those based on official records  (e.g., arrests or medical record data) [66].  in addition, we have no reason to suspect  differential reporting of ipv by socioeconomic characteristics of study women, especially  since all participants were low income.  second, our cross-sectional design limited our ability  to examine temporal associations.  thus, it is possible that ipv resulted in extreme poverty or  need for public assistance, although partner’s lower educational attainment or unemployment 


24 likely preceded his ipv perpetration.  in addition, our finding that separated or divorced  women had much higher past-year ipv rates than women who were married or had a steady  boyfriend could mean that divorce/separation increases ipv risk or that risk of  divorce/separation is increased in violent relationships.  third, although our study is among  the largest published investigations of ipv against native women, small cell sizes limited our  ability to fully explore interactions among social and demographic variables.  last, and most  important, our sample was by no means representative of all native american women, nor of  any specific tribe.  there are approximately 1.5 million native women aged 15 and older in  the united states, from a diverse population of over 560 different tribes, many with distinct  customs, languages, and traditions [23,67,68].  although our response rate was very high  (96%), our sample was not population-based; we studied a clinic-based sample of native  american wic clients in southwest oklahoma, the majority of whom did not have native  american partners.  our sample was comprised of women enrolled in one of 29 diverse  tribes, nearly all with present-day land bases in oklahoma.  we believe this sample to be  generally representative of low-income native women of childbearing age in the study area.   conclusions  these findings demonstrate that an exceptionally high percentage of low-income native  american women in southwest oklahoma experience lifetime and past-year ipv, much of  which is severe and results in injuries.  further, we found strong evidence of socioeconomic  variability in ipv within this low-income sample: past-year ipv prevalence was 42.8%  among women scoring low on our combined socioeconomic index, compared with 10.1%  among the reference group.  these data provide support for the hypothesis that poor  socioeconomic conditions are a major contributor to high rates of ipv victimization among  native american women.  further research should determine prevalence of ipv against 


25 native women from diverse tribes and regions, and examine pathways through which  socioeconomic disadvantage may increase their ipv risk.  competing interests none declared. authors' contributions lhm conceived of and designed the study, directed its implementation, conducted and  synthesized analyses, and drafted and revised the manuscript.  bmd contributed to data  analysis and interpretation, and manuscript revisions.  jmm contributed to data collection,  data management, initial data analysis, and manuscript revisions.  all authors read and  approved the final manuscript. acknowledgements  this study was funded by the oklahoma area indian health service.  the national indian  health service (ihs) publication and review committee of the ihs institutional review  board reviewed and approved this manuscript for publication.  the authors gratefully  acknowledge the contributions of several individuals and tribes.  we refrain from giving  names to protect the confidentiality of study participants.  special thanks to: each woman  who participated in this study; the tribal leaders for their support and use of tribal facilities;  the wic clinic directors for their steadfast support and advice throughout the project; the  wic clinic and data collection staff for their assistance in recruitment of study participants;  and the graduate research assistants for data entry and data management.
