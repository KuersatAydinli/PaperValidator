    abstract   background: patients experience increasing treatment burden related to everything they do to  take care of their health: visits to the doctor, medical tests, treatment management and  lifestyle changes. treatment burden could affect treatment adherence, quality of life and  outcomes. we aimed to develop and validate an instrument measuring treatment burden for  patients with multiple chronic conditions.  methods: items were derived from a literature review and qualitative semi-structured  interviews with patients. the instrument was then validated in a sample of patients with  chronic conditions recruited in hospitals and general practitioner clinics in france. factor  analysis was used to examine the questionnaire structure. construct validity was studied by  the relationships between the instrument’s global score, the treatment satisfaction  questionnaire for medication (tsqm) scores and the complexity of treatment as assessed by  patients and physicians. agreement between patients and physicians was appraised.  reliability was determined by a test–retest method.   results: a sample of 502 patients completed the treatment burden questionnaire (tbq),  which consisted of 7 items (2 of which had 4 sub-items) defined after 22 interviews with  patients. the questionnaire showed a unidimensional structure. the cronbach’s alpha was  0.89. the instrument’s global score was negatively correlated with tsqm scores (rs = -0.41– - 0.53) and positively correlated with the complexity of treatment (rs =0.16–0.40). agreement  between patients and physicians (n=396) was weak (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.38  [95% confidence interval 0.29–0.47]). reliability of the retest (n=211 patients) was 0.76  [0.67–0.83].   


conclusions: this study provided the first valid and reliable instrument assessing the  treatment burden for patients across any disease or treatment context. this instrument could  help in the development of treatment strategies that are both efficient and acceptable for  patients.     keywords  chronic disease/therapy  patient participation  physician-patient relations  workload  quality of life  questionnaires                           


         background  chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing more than 36  million deaths in 2008 [1]. about 45% of the population and 88% of people older than 65  years have at least one chronic condition. the prevalence of chronic diseases continues to  increase: in 2020, nearly 50% of the us population will have at least one chronic condition  [2]. therefore, the challenge for physicians has switched from curing acute illnesses to  managing multiple chronic conditions. however, illnesses are still the primary focus of  medical care [3] and many clinical practice guidelines focus on single conditions. for  example, a physician following extant guidelines could prescribe up to 12 medications for a  patient with osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease [4].   being a patient implies more investment of time and effort than just taking medicines. it also  involves drug management, self-monitoring, visits to the doctor, lab tests and changes of  lifestyle. for example, patients with type 2 diabetes controlled by oral agents could spend 143  min daily in recommended self-care [5]. this workload can affect quality of life as severely as  the illness itself, and patients rate this treatment burden equal to that of diabetic neuropathy or  nephropathy [6].   treatment burden can be defined as the impact of health care on patients’ functioning and  well-being, apart from specific treatment side effects [7, 8]. it takes into account everything  patients do to take care of their health: visits to the doctor, medical tests, treatment  management, and lifestyle changes. treatment burden is associated, independently of 


illnesses, with adherence to therapeutic care [9, 10] and could affect hospitalization [11] and  survival rates [12].  minimally disruptive medicine seeks to tailor treatment to the contexts of patients by  integrating the notion of treatment burden in their care [13]. therefore, caregivers need tools  to establish the weight of the treatment burden. many instruments assess treatment burden for  specific conditions [14-18], but none has been developed to assess this burden globally across  multiple chronic diseases. because the treatment burden grows from the combination of  chronic diseases, only an instrument that assesses it globally could help clinicians and  researchers develop effective therapeutic programs that minimize the treatment workload  [13].  we aimed to develop a measure of treatment burden for patients with at least one chronic  condition. this measure should be of use in daily clinical practice and in clinical research.  methods  we used a multistep method to develop a tool to measure the treatment burden of chronic  diseases [19, 20] following the quality criteria proposed in the literature [21].   stage 1: elaboration of the questionnaire  the objective of the instrument was to capture the perception of treatment burden of patients  as “the work of being a patient” dealing with increasingly complex treatment regimens [13],  that is, the impact of the workload of healthcare on a patient’s well-being and functioning.   we searched medline via pubmed for literature on treatment burden and existing  questionnaires assessing it in specific diseases. we found no instrument appraising the  treatment burden globally. treatment burden was often assessed only as a subscale of specific  disease scales [14-17] and thus was considered only for the regimen associated with a 


particular condition. items often focused on drug intake, adherence to care and convenience of  use.   using this literature review, 3 members of the team, who had experience in the care of  patients with chronic diseases (vtt, bf, pr), highlighted possible relevant topics to capture  the aspects of the workload of healthcare that could affect a patient’s life. these topics were  the burden associated with taking medicines, self-surveillance, lab tests, doctor visits, need for  organization, administrative tasks, following advice on diet and physical exercise and social  impact of the treatment. according to the conceptual model of our instrument, we chose not to  include other consequences of the treatment such as treatment side effects.  in addition, because our instrument was elaborated in france and administered to french  patients, we did not take into account the financial burden of treatment, because our national  public health insurance program guarantees healthcare free of charge for patients with chronic  conditions.   we recruited a convenience sample of 22 patients, with at least one chronic condition, from  the department of internal medicine of hospital pitié-salpetrière and a general practitioner  clinic in paris in april 2011 (appendix 1). these 2 settings involved patients with various  chronic conditions, requiring primary, secondary and tertiary care. during semi-structured  interviews, we presented the concept of treatment burden to patients and asked them about  their diseases, their treatment and the burden of treatment, with open-ended questions: “could  you tell us about your health problems?” “could you tell us about what you have to do to take  care of your health?”  “what aspects of your care have the most impact on your life?” then,  we asked them about the burden associated with the different topics highlighted earlier by  asking them 1) to rate each of these items, 2) to explain why they would rate it like that and 3)  if they found the item relevant in the assessment of treatment burden generally. finally, we 


asked patients, if other aspects of the workload of healthcare bothered them. as a result of  these interviews, examples were added to the items, and we added one item “frequent  healthcare reminds me of my health problems” to the questionnaire.  the resulting questionnaire consisted of 7 items (2 of which had 4 sub-items), formed by an  introductory sentence with examples, followed by a rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 with  numbers placed under boxes and labeled end-anchors (“no burden” and “considerable  burden”) [22-24].  a group of 10 physicians (2 methodologists, 3 general practitioners, 2 internists, 1  cardiologist, 1 pneumologist, 1 diabetologist) with experience in the care of patients with  chronic conditions, some of whom had experience in questionnaire development, reviewed  the clarity and wording of the items. all physicians agreed that, on the surface, items  appeared to be measuring what they actually were and that the instrument achieved face  validity.     stage 2: measurement properties of the instrument   the measurement properties of the questionnaire were assessed by 4 steps: 1) reduction of the  number of items, 2) assessment of factorial validity, 3) assessment of construct validity and 4)  assessment of reliability.   we recruited consecutive patients from 6 teaching hospitals of the assistance-publique  hôpitaux de paris and 8 general practitioner clinics in paris to validate the questionnaire.  patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older, were able to complete a consent form  and had at least one condition requiring medical follow-up for at least 6 months. patients with 


cognitive impairment that could interfere with understanding the questionnaire were excluded.  all patients provided written informed consent to be in the study.  reducing the number of items was based on 1) a floor effect, considered present if more than  15% of respondents had the lowest score [21]; 2) the relevance of the items, assessed by the  number of answers for which patients checked “does not apply”; and 3) item redundancy,  suspected when inter-item correlations by spearman’s correlation coefficient were > 0.80  [19]. items were eliminated after discussion among 3 investigators (vtt, bf, pr).  answers to the questionnaire were aggregated in a global score by summing the item  responses. “does not apply” or missing answers were considered the lowest possible score (0)  because we considered that a patient not concerned by a domain of the treatment burden had  no burden for that domain.   factorial validity was assessed by determining the dimensional structure of the questionnaire  by use of factor analysis. scree plots were used to visualize a break between factors with large  and small eigenvalues. factors that appeared before the horizontal break were assumed to be  meaningful. internal consistency was assessed by cronbach’s alpha [25] and was considered  acceptable between 0.70 and 0.95 [26].   construct validity was obtained by confirming 2 constructs theorized on the treatment burden  [27]. first, we hypothesized a negative correlation between treatment burden, defined as the  work of dealing with complex treatment regimens, and treatment satisfaction, defined as the  balance between expectations about the treatment, side effects, convenience of use, and  perceived efficacy. treatment satisfaction was assessed by the treatment satisfaction  questionnaire for medication (tsqm), an 11-item questionnaire validated in a population  with diverse chronic conditions, measuring patient satisfaction with various medications  designed to treat, control or prevent a wide variety of medical conditions [28, 29]. tsqm 


scores range from 0 to 100 and measure patient satisfaction with the treatment’s effectiveness,  side effects, convenience and globally. correlations were expected to be higher between our  instrument and the tsqm convenience score because some items overlapped. second, we  assumed a positive correlation between the patient evaluation of the treatment burden and  treatment workload evaluated by items on 1) drug intake (number of tablets, injections and  intakes per day); 2) medical follow-up (number of different physicians, medical appointments  per month and hospitalizations per year); and 3) daily time spent on self-care. the correlations  between the global questionnaire score, the tsqm scores and treatment workload variables  were assessed by spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and considered high with rs > 0.50 and  moderate with rs 0.35–0.50 [30]. wilcoxon and kruskal-wallis tests were used to compare  measurements for qualitative variables across groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically  significant. we used linear regression analyses to examine variables that predicted the global  questionnaire score. relationships were characterized with beta coefficients, standard errors,  and percent variance explained (adjusted r ) within these models. heteroskedasticity was  corrected by the method described by greene et al. [31].  description of our sample was completed by clustering homogenous groups of patients  depending on the similarity of their response patterns to the treatment burden questionnaire  and analysis of treatment workload variables in each cluster of patients. clustering involved a  hierarchical ascendant classification with a ward’s distance method [32]. the number of  clusters was determined so as to have a minimal sample of 100 patients. stability of clustering  was assessed by a 2-fold cross-validation method.  we compared the patient’s self-evaluation of treatment burden with an evaluation by their  physician and by an informal caregiver using the same questionnaire adapted for hetero- evaluation. physicians and informal caregivers were asked to make the best estimate of the  patient’s treatment burden from their perspective. 


reliability of the instrument was determined by a test–retest method. patients completed the  new instrument twice: at baseline and after 2 weeks or 1 month. reliability was assessed by  the icc for agreement [33]. 95% confidence intervals (95% cis) were determined by a  bootstrap method. agreement was considered acceptable with icc > 0.60 [27, 34].  agreement was represented by bland and altman plots, which represent the differences  between 2 measurements against the means of the 2 measurements [35].   statistical analyses involved use of sas v9.2 (sas inst., cary, nc) and r v2.13.1.   this study was approved by the institutional review board of hospital bichat (irb:  00006477).  results  in total, 502 patients (mean age 59.3 [±17] years; 266 women [53.1%]) were included to  validate the questionnaire from april 2011 to september 2011 in france; 257 were inpatients  (51.2%) and 300 reported a symptomatic disease (62.6%) (table 1). self-reported main  chronic conditions ranged from diabetes (16.5%) to cancers (6.9%) and included well- controlled psychiatric illnesses (1.6%).   during item reduction, we eliminated the sub-item “the conditions to store your medications  (in your refrigerator etc.)” because a large number of patients responded “does not apply”  (51.6%) and it had a large floor effect (64.0%) (appendix 2). therefore, the final version of  the questionnaire, the treatment burden questionnaire (tbq), consisted of 7 items (2 of  which had 4 sub-items) (table 2).  factorial validity, assessed by scree plots, favored a unidimensional instrument because 91%  of the variance was explained by the first principal factor (figure 1 and appendix 3).  cronbach’s alpha was 0.89. the global score of the treatment burden questionnaire was the 


sum of the answers to each item and ranged from 0 to 130. it was highly correlated with every  item of the questionnaire (rs=0.47–0.68) (appendix 4).   construct validity showed 1) a moderate negative correlation of the treatment burden  questionnaire score with the tsqm global and convenience scores (rs = -0.41 and rs = -0.53)  and a weak negative correlation with the tsqm efficacy score (rs = -0.26) (table 3a) and 2)  a significant association of scores for variables used to describe treatment workload and the  treatment burden questionnaire global score (table 3b).   using hierarchical ascendant classification, we clustered our sample in 3 homogenous groups  of patients by the answers to the treatment burden questionnaire (appendix 5). two-fold  cross validation showed stable clustering results. the global score was 11.3 (±9.2) in the first  cluster, 34.6 (±11.1) in the second cluster and 65.8 (±18.1) in the third cluster. therefore, we  defined the clusters as patients with low, moderate and high burden of treatment. descriptive  analysis of the treatment workload items within the 3 clusters showed that scores for these  variables were significantly higher for patients with high treatment burden (table 4).  treatment workload variables could explain up to 69% of the variability in the patient’s score.  prediction of global score with these variables was more accurate with high than low  treatment burden (r =0.86 vs. r =0.62) (appendix 6). treatment burden score was  significantly higher when patients experienced medication side effects (p <0.0001) and for  patients whose treatment did not relieve their symptoms (p<0.0001).  we found a moderate agreement (icc 0.60 [0.28-0.79]) between patient and informal  caregiver global scores (39 informal caregivers [7.8%] completed the questionnaire)  (appendix 7a). bland and altman plots showed a mean difference of -8.7; 95% limits of  agreement were -58.0 and 40.7 (appendix 7b). agreement between patient and physician  global scores was weak (icc 0.38 [0.29-0.47]) (396 physicians [78.9%] completed the  questionnaire) (appendix 8). bland and altman plot showed a mean difference of -7.6; 95% 


limits of agreement were -60.7 and 45.4 (figure 2). agreement between patient and general  practitioner (n=209) evaluations was icc=0.42 [0.27-0.54]. agreement between patient and  hospital specialists (n=187) evaluations was icc=0.29 [0.14-0.42] (appendix 9). treatment  workload variables could explain up to 76% of the variation in physician evaluations and was  more accurate for patients with high than low treatment burden (r =0.82 vs. r =0.72)  (appendix 6).  retests were obtained for 211 patients (42.0%). for the global score, the icc for all retests  was 0.76 [0.67 - 0.83] (appendix 10a). bland and altman plots showed a mean difference of  -5.9; 95% limits of agreement were -42.4 and 30.5 (appendix 10b). reliability for the 2- week retest group (n=182) was consistent with the 1-month retest group (n=29) (icc=0.75  [0.65-0.83] vs. icc=0.78 [0.46 - 0.91]).  discussion  in this study, we presented a unidimensional valid and reliable instrument assessing the  treatment burden of chronic diseases for patients with multiple chronic conditions. this  patient-reported measure took into account the burden associated with drug intake,  surveillance, lifestyle changes and the impact of healthcare on social relationships.   the instrument could help in clinical research for developing clinical practice guidelines  adapted to the realities of patient lives. in addition, it could be used in clinical practice as a  validated global score that is easy to calculate to identify patients overwhelmed by their  treatment to help begin conversations about treatment burden with these patients.  we highlighted a negative correlation between treatment burden and treatment satisfaction:  the more satisfied patients were with their treatment, the less the treatment burden. we  expected that our scale score would correlate highly with the tsqm convenience score 


because some items overlapped. however, patients with side effects and who found the  treatment inefficient would feel less agreeable to integrate the treatment in their lives.  treatment burden did not concern only patients taking a lot of medications: 25% of patients in  our sample took < 3 medications a day and still had a median treatment burden score of 17  (q1q3: 6–36). therefore, treatment burden should be taken into account for every patient,  because it could be associated with adherence to care [9] and thus could contribute to  hospitalizations and survival rates [11]. however, physicians were often not fully aware of  their patients’ investment of time and efforts to comply with every prescription: we found  only weak agreement between evaluation of treatment burden between patients and  physicians. even for specific domains such as self-monitoring or the prescription of a diet,  physicians could not predict their patient’s evaluation. general practitioners, who are  coordinators of care in france, have better knowledge than hospital specialists of how patients  cope with everything they do to take care of their health (icc=0.42 for general practitioners  and 0.20 for hospital specialists) but still fail to assess patients’ treatment burden accurately.  this finding is not unexpected, because treatment burden is a relatively new concept to  physicians [13] and expresses a patient experience that is not shared in depth during  consultations[36].  in existing questionnaires, treatment burden was often considered only as a subscale for larger  disease-specific scales [16, 17] and focused on a single treatment regimen. given the  increasing number of patients with multiple chronic diseases and complex treatment  regimens, measuring global treatment burden seems increasingly important. as gallacher et  al. have shown for chronic heart failure, treatment burden relates to how patients cope with  their treatment [37]: 1) learning about treatment and their consequences, 2) monitoring the  treatment, 3) adhering to treatment and lifestyle changes and 4) engaging with others. during  our study, we asked patients about aspects of their healthcare that were not mentioned in our 


questionnaire but had an impact on their lives. we found the same domains of treatment  burden as gallacher et al., with the exception of gaining an understanding about illness and  treatments. nevertheless, acquiring this knowledge is an important burden in the management  of chronic conditions, especially when patients have to make sense of the disparate and  conflicting information they gather from different sources.  however, because we recruited  patients with illnesses for at least 6 months, they might have already coped with this particular  burden, adapted to it, and therefore did not mention it.  the strengths of this study included field-testing the instrument in a large sample of both  inpatients and outpatients with different conditions and treatment regimens, which ensured  that our instrument was flexible enough for assessing the treatment burden across any disease  or context. however, we found a significant floor effect and a large proportion of “does not  apply” responses for all of our scales. this result was expected because treatment burden  depends on how patients cope with their treatment regimens. therefore, patients could have  no burden in aspects of their care they have integrated in their lives. as well, patients with  similar treatment regimens could have very different treatment burdens.. still, domains not  included in this instrument may be critical to some of these patients. during the validation  study, we systematically searched for other aspects of treatment burden that could have an  impact on patients' quality of life but found no preeminent domain.   more work in measuring treatment burden is needed. because treatment burden depends on  the context of patients (social or family structure, care delivery system) [13] and because our  instrument was developed in france, we could not exclude that different domains could arise  in other settings. as an example, the financial burden of the treatment did not arise from our  qualitative interviews because the public health insurance program in france guarantees  healthcare free of charge for patients with chronic conditions. in addition, depending on the  social or family structure, the treatment burden may be shared by the patient with one or more 


informal caregivers, thus affecting the validity of the measure when only reported by the  patient.   our instrument on treatment burden for patients exhibiting multiple chronic conditions  provides the first valid and reliable solution to assess the burden of treatment across any  disease or treatment context. it may help in the development of treatment strategies that are  both efficient and acceptable for patients.  competing interests: the authors declare that they have no competing interests.    contributors: vtt, bf and pr conceived and designed the study. vtt and db acquired the  data. vtt, bf, pr analyzed and interpreted the data. vtt and pr drafted the manuscript.  vm, bf, de, db and pr critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content.  db and pr provided administrative, technical, and material support. all authors saw and  approved the final manuscript. pr is the guarantor, had full access to the data in the study,  and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.   acknowledgments: the authors thank michel nougairède, anna christidis, gaële duriez- mize, marie-anne puel, philippe fabri, ismael nureni-banafunzi, elena kisseleva, gilbert  dhumerelle, anne simon, serge herson, jacques blacher, christian boitard, gérard huchon,  jean-françois bergmann, alain cohen-solal, olivier meyer, serge poiraudeau and loïc  guillevin for permission to collect data; clémence palazzo for assistance in data acquisition;  gabriel baron and viet-chi tran for help in the analysis of the data; and laura smales for  reviewing the manuscript before submission.
