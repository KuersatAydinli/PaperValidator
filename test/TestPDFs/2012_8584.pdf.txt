    abstract  background: a season of birth effect in immune mediated diseases (id) such as multiple sclerosis (ms)  and type 1 diabetes has been consistently reported. we aimed to investigate whether season of birth  influences the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and systemic lupus  erythematosus in addition to ms and to explore the correlation between risk of id and predicted  ultraviolet b (uvb) light exposure and vitamin d status during gestation.   methods: the monthly distribution of births of id patients from the united kingdom (n=115,172) was  compared to that of the general population using the cosinor test. predicted uvb radiation and vitamin  d status in different time windows during pregnancy were calculated for each month of birth and  correlated with risk of id using the spearman’s correlation coefficient.  results: the distributions of id births significantly differed from that of the general population (p=5e-12)  with peak in april (or=1.045, 95%ci=1.024-1.067, p<0.0001) and trough in october (or=0.945,  95%ci=0.925-0.966, p<0.0001). stratification by disease subtype showed seasonality in all id but crohn’s  disease. the risk of id was inversely correlated with predicted second trimester uvb exposure  (spearman’s rho=-0.49, p=0.00005) and third trimester vitamin d status (spearman’s rho=-0.44,  p=0.0003).  conclusions: the risk of different id in the united kingdom is significantly influenced by the season of  birth suggesting the presence of a shared seasonal risk factor/s predisposing to immune diseases.  gestational uvb and vitamin d exposure may be implicated in the aetiology of id. 


    background  complex disorders such as immune mediated diseases (id) are defined as conditions that have no single  cause but result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. id  affect approximately 5-10% of the developed world and the overall incidence seems to be increasing [1].  this observation suggests that changes in environment and lifestyle play a central role in influencing  prevalence.   seasonality dominates the global environment and diet is closely related to seasonality by the effect of  these environmental fluctuations on agriculture [2]. seasonal factors can potentially act even before  birth, when according to the “fetal origin of adult disease hypothesis“, environmental influences leading  to changes in embryonic/fetal tissue structure and function can influence the risk of adult physiological  and pathological conditions [3-4]. as a consequence, being born at a certain time of the year may  influence susceptibility to disease later in life. indeed, month of birth effects have already been  documented in id such as multiple sclerosis (ms) and type 1 diabetes (t1d) [5-7]. in addition to ms and  t1d, a few other studies have investigated the presence of a month of birth effect in other id. however,  poor sample sizes and inadequate statistical methods have significantly hampered these attempts and  results are inconsistent [8-16].   the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of immune mediated disorders are variable and both  adaptive and innate immune responses have been implicated in diseases such as ms, rheumatoid  arthritis (ra), systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), crohn’s disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) [17- 20]. for example, in ms and ra tolerance breakdown is thought to cause immune mediated  demyelination of the central nervous system and cartilage and bone destruction respectively [18, 21]. by  contrast several lines of evidence suggest that cd and uc arise from an inappropriate immune reaction  to the intestinal microbiota in genetically predisposed hosts [20]. despite these differences, an  abnormal activation of the immune system is a common thread linking these conditions and several 


    observations indicate that similar genetic pathways and environmental agents such as vitamin d  deficiency, smoking behavior and various infections are involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders  [18-20, 22-25].   this led us to the a-priori hypothesis that a similar seasonality of birth may be present among different  id. we investigated whether the month of birth influences susceptibility to ra, sle, cd and uc in  addition to ms using the largest cohort to date to investigate these effects  (n=115,172). since all these  conditions have been linked to vitamin d deficiency [23-24], we also tested whether the risk of disease  by month of birth follows the same seasonal distribution of predicted ultraviolet b (uvb) light radiation  and 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25-oh-d) levels during gestation.       methods  month of birth for ms (n= 15,492), ra (n=39,666), sle (n= 4,046), cd (n= 20,574) and uc (n= 23,892)  patients seen by a doctor between 1997 and 2009 in scotland and between 2003 and 2009 in england  were obtained from the nhs national service scotland and the english hospital episode statistics (hes).   for ms, an additional cohort of patients (n=11,502) and matched controls was collected as previously  described [5], giving a total of 26,994 ms patients. general population controls were obtained from the  general register office (http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/) and the office for national statistics  (http://www.ons.gov.uk/). scottish controls were based on month of birth registration between 1954  and 1973 and actual month of birth between 1974 and 1990. english controls were based on actual  month of birth between 1950 and 1990. in total month of birth data were collected for 115,172 id  patients (26,162 english and 89,010 scottish, table 1) as well as for 3,028,621 scottish and 29,202,890  english controls.   


    table 1    we compared cases and controls using the cosinor test which is able to capture seasonal distributions  and is particularly suitable for relatively simple and symmetric seasonal patterns. this test fits a  generalized linear model under the poisson distribution using a sine and cosine terms that together  describe the sinusoid. in addition to statistical significance, the model provides information on the  amplitude (the height) and the phase (the peak point from 1 to 12 indicating months) of the predicted  sinusoid [26]. monthly odds ratios (or) were also calculated by comparing frequencies of patients and  controls born in a certain month vs the rest of the year.   average monthly uvb radiation at the wavelength of 305 nm at noon (joules/square metre) in england  and scotland between 1979 and 1992 was obtained from nasa’s total ozone mapping program on the  nimbus 7 satellite as previously described [27]. average monthly 25-oh-d levels were collected from a  large cohort of adult scottish and english women (n=3,787) as previously described [28] and used as a  proxy for the seasonal variation in gestational vitamin d status. average predicted uvb exposure as well  as vitamin d status during the first, second and third trimesters of gestation were calculated for each  month of birth and tested for correlation with risk of id (monthly or) using the spearman’s correlation  coefficient. statistical analyses were performed using r.    results  in order to assess whether month of birth influences susceptibility to immune disorders we initially  compared the distribution of all id patients with that of the general population. using the cosinor test,  the birth distribution of id patients was found to follow a seasonal distribution as compared to the  general population (p=5e-12, amplitude=0.033, phase=3.08, low point=9.08). when monthly ors were  calculated, a statistically significant peak was found in april (or=1.045, 95%ci=1.024-1.067, p<0.0001) 


    and a significant trough exactly six months later in october (or=0.945, 95%ci=0.925-0.966, p<0.0001). a  smaller deficit was also detected in august (or=0.972, 95%ci=0.951-0.9927, p=0.008) (figure 1). the  peak to trough ratio indicated the presence of a 6.5% increased risk for individuals born in april vs those  born in october (or=1.065, 95%ci=1.035- 1.096, p<0.0001).    figure 1    when the analysis was performed according to country, the seasonal effect appeared to be present in  both england and scotland (scotland p=5e-10, amplitude=0.034, phase=3.05, low point=9.05; england  p=0.005, amplitude=0.032 phase=3.23, low point=9.23). the highest and lowest monthly ors were  found in the scottish population, however 95% confidence intervals were substantially overlapping  (figure 2).    figure 2    the seasonality of birth detected by grouping all id patients could arise from a single disease such as  ms, for which the presence of a month of birth effect has already been described. we therefore  stratified the analysis by disease type. the cosinor test indicated the presence of clear seasonality in all  id but cd: ms (p=5e-06; amplitude=0.041, phase=4.12, low point=10.12); ra (p=5e-04,  amplitude=0.032, phase=2.69, low point=8.69); uc (p=5e-04, amplitude=0.04, phase=2.74, low  point=8.74); sle (p=0.025; amplitude=0.063; phase=2.89; low point=8.89); cd (p>0.05). when  calculating monthly ors, peaks in spring and deficit in autumn could be observed in each id apart from  cd in which a january rather than spring peak was found. birth percentages and monthly ors with 95%  confidence intervals are presented in table 2.  


      table 2    we next investigated whether the monthly risk of id inversely correlated with predicted gestational uvb  exposure and vitamin d status during different trimesters of pregnancy. based on the nimbus 7 satellite,  in the united kingdom uvb radiation reaches the minimum and maximum levels during winter  (december-january) and summer (june-july) respectively. the highest and lowest 25-oh-d levels were  collected during september and february respectively [28]. figure 3 shows the direct relation between  uvb radiation and vitamin d status and the amount of time required for a change in uvb to impact on  vitamin d metabolism. the peak and the trough of 25-oh-d levels are shifted approximately 2-3 months  later than uvb radiation (two months lag: spearman’s rho=0.91, p<2.2e-16; three months lag:  spearman’s rho=0.88, p=0.002). this is consistent with previous reports [29].    figure 3    we found that the monthly risk of id inversely correlated with predicted uvb exposure during the  second trimester of pregnancy (spearman’s rho=-0.49, p=0.00005). similarly, predicted maternal 25-oh- d levels were also inversely associated with risk of id but the negative correlation was shifted to the  third trimester (spearman’s rho=-0.44, p=0.0003) (figure 4).    figure 4         


    discussion  we report here the largest study performed on id and seasonality of birth. when patients suffering from  different conditions were grouped together a clear seasonal birth distribution was observed with peak in  april and trough exactly six months later in october. the effect size of being born at the “wrong time”  appears very low, with the highest ors being under 1.1. however, considering the increased risk of all id  in rest of the year vs october born individuals and the proportion of population born in months other  than october, the population proportional attributable risk percent (ppar) is 5.05%. this suggests that  approximately 5 percent of id cases could be prevented by ameliorating the risk factor responsible for  the seasonal distribution of id births. the season of birth effect was particularly clear in scotland as  compared to england but no prominent differences between the two sites could be observed.  that the risk of ms varies by month of birth had already been shown in a number of regions including  canada, denmark, sweden, sardinia, finland, england, scotland and australia [5, 30-34]. we further  confirmed these findings by increasing the sample size of a previously analyzed cohort of uk ms patients  [5]. based on the cosinor test also ra, uc and sle births followed a clear seasonal distribution. notably,  all the predicted sinusoids peaked around the same period with phases ranging from 2.69 to 4.12 (late  winter-spring). in contrast to other id the distribution of cd births was not seasonal.   the presence of seasonality of births among uc but not cd patients is interesting but difficult to  interpret. somehow similar is the observation that the season of birth effect in ms is present among  relapsing remitting but not primary progressive ms patients [35]. it is therefore plausible to observe  such differences between similar but distinct phenotypes. furthermore, increasing evidence supports  the presence of gene-environment interactions in disease aetiology [36-37] and particular genetic  variants could be involved and mediating the season of birth effect. although many genetic variants  influence the risk of both uc and cd, many others (including variants located within the major 


    histocompatibility complex) appear to be disease specific and this could contribute to the observed  difference between uc and cd births [20, 38-41].   a recent australian study reported an inverse association between the risk of ms and uvb exposure  during the first trimester of gestation [31]. however, the sample size was relatively small (n=1,524) and  thus analysis had to be performed using bi-monthly periods. furthermore, the seasonal variation of 25- oh-d levels was not investigated and no other studies have tried to answer the same question in id  other than ms. we found that the risk of id was inversely associated with predicted second trimester  uvb exposure and third trimester vitamin d status. these findings are interesting since several lines of  evidence now support a role for vitamin d deficiency in the pathogenesis of id [23-24]. notably, vitamin  d production is strictly dependent on uvb radiation and vitamin d levels therefore follow a seasonal  distribution [23]. this is also the case among pregnant women whose vitamin d status largely depends  on season and follows the same distribution of the general population levels [28, 42-43]. furthermore,  in utero vitamin d deficiency has a significant effect on the developing immune system and our group  has recently shown that genes associated with ms, ra, cd, sle and t1d are significantly enriched for  vitamin d receptor binding sites [44-46]. in addition to its well known immunological roles, this  exceptionally pleiotropic hormone has been implicated in autophagy and mucosal barrier homeostasis  which are thought to play a pathogenic role in cd and uc [20, 47-48]. it may be that in utero vitamin d  deficiency, in conjunction with individual genetic variation and subsequent exposure to other  environmental agents may then lead to disease specificity. notably, schizophrenia is also influenced by  the season of birth and a recent study has shown that neonatal vitamin d levels are significantly  associated with risk of schizophrenia later in life [49-50]. future studies should try to answer the same  question in ms as well as in other id.  this study has limitations. information on sex and ethnicity was not available and this may have  confounded our results. furthermore the data we gathered from the scottish nhs and the english hes 


    could not be restricted to uk born but only to uk resident individuals. however the enormous sample  size (115,172 id cases), the relatively homogeneous scottish population and the strong a priori evidence  for a month of birth effect in ms make the risk of a spurious association improbable. furthermore it is  striking that the id analyzed (apart from cd) show a similar seasonal risk distribution which is also the  one reported in t1d patients [6-7]. this makes the data unlikely to be a chance finding.   we were limited to using average uvb radiation and general population vitamin d measures which may  differ from the individual maternal exposures. it is important to note that our uvb and vitamin d  correlation analysis does not prove causation and that although the vitamin d hypothesis is supported  by both epidemiological and functional observations, seasonality dominates many features of the global  environment and other seasonal factors may play a role in determining the risk of id. climate,  temperature, infectious disease and maternal nutrition are all characterized by seasonality and thus  represent excellent candidate factors.     conclusions  to conclude the susceptibility to different id in the united kingdom is influenced by the season of birth.  this is particularly clear in patients suffering from ms, ra, uc and sle and suggests that at least some  proportion of id risk is preventable. gestational vitamin d deficiency appears to be a plausible causative  agent. the identification of the seasonal factor/s responsible for such observations will be crucial for  disease prevention strategies.
