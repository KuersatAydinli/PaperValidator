the extent to which patients are able to recall their medical information has important implications for treat- ment adherence, patient satisfaction and subsequent health outcomes.7 8 in general, recall of medical informa- tion is low.9–12 health information is often complex and may be incongruent with patients’ perceptions. furthermore, factors such as patient age, education, liter- acy levels, anxiety and stress impact upon a patient’s ability to remember the information presented.13–16 not surprisingly, several studies have demonstrated that parents recall pertinent details about their child’s health (such as diagnoses or major injuries) more than periph- eral details (such as tests completed in a consultation, prescriptions or follow-up appointments).15 17 18 in the context of screening for overweight in children, it would appear that parents can recall important infor- mation, such as their child’s weight status, following a posted letter.19 however, understanding of the results and bmi charts and/or percentiles is very low.20 to date, most evaluations of bmi screening simply measure whether parents recall receiving the letter. only a few studies20–22 have assessed whether parents understand bmi charts and percentiles, and none have done so after receiving bmi results in a face-to-face consultation, as would occur in a primary care setting. this is an import- ant distinction as it may be that a letter of results provides an enduring memory cue or resource, which enables parents to better retain the information and refer to it if need be. alternatively, a face-to-face session may enhance recall and understanding, given the opportunity to discuss the results and ask questions, thereby strengthen- ing encoding of the information and creating stronger recall. we recently examined whether motivational interview- ing (mi) was an appropriate way of informing parents that their young child was overweight following bmi screening.23 24 parents attended a second session 2 weeks later providing the opportunity for us to examine how well they recalled the information given in this face-to-face feedback session. speciﬁcally, we exam- ined how much information parents could recall from the bmi screening session, which types of information were more likely to be recalled, the accuracy of parental recall and how recall varied according to feedback style. factors that may predict better recall performance were also explored. this manuscript represents a secondary data analysis from our main trial.24 while recall was not speciﬁed a priori as a variable of interest, it was consid- ered a component of how well parents understood the feedback process.23 subjects and methods this manuscript presents data from a large randomised controlled study (rct) which has been described in detail previously.23 in brief, mint was a bmi screening initiative (phase 1) to recruit children into a 2-year family-based intervention in overweight children (phase 2). phase 1 entailed a comparison of weight feedback delivered using best practice care (bpc) or mi whereas phase 2 compared a usual care intervention with a more intense intervention tailored to the needs of each family. parents gave informed consent. participants a total of 1093 children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, recruited from local primary care practices and secondary care clinics in dunedin, new zealand, were screened for overweight at a university research clinic. parents were randomised to receive feedback (phase 1, screening) delivered using a bpc (n=540) or mi approach (n=553) using random block lengths (stata v.12.0, statacorp, college station, texas, usa) after stratifying for practice, with sealed, opaque envelopes. participants were blinded to randomisation condition.24 only those parents with overweight children (bmi >85th centile)25 were eligible for the current study (n=271; ﬁgure 1). these parents were invited to participate in a recall interview at the university approximately 2 weeks later to discuss the feedback they received about their child’s growth (phase 1, follow-up). twenty parents declined participation in the recall interview. a further seven participants were excluded due to technical difﬁ- culties with audio recordings (n=6) and one had brought the feedback booklet with them to the interview making them unsuitable for assessing recall of feedback. procedures screening parents (virtually all mothers, fathers <2%) completed a comprehensive online questionnaire assessing demo- graphic characteristics including ethnicity, maternal edu- cation, an index of socioeconomic status (new zealand deprivation index, nzdep200626) and maternal age. parental concern about their child’s weight and percep- tion of their weight status was assessed using a 5-point likert scale question (where 1=not at all concerned and 5=very concerned for levels of concern; and 1=under- weight, 2=a little underweight, 3=about right, 4=a little overweight, 5=overweight for levels of perception). we calculated a discrepancy score to indicate the extent to which the parent under- or over-rated their child’s weight status by comparing the parental perception of their child’s weight status with their actual bmi classiﬁcation (underweight=<3rd centile, normal weight=3rd–84th centile, a little overweight=85th–94th centile, overweight=≥95th centile). scores of 1 or 2 for the perception of underweight were combined in this comparison. duplicate anthropometric measurements (height, weight and waist) and blood pressure (bp) (dinamap: ge medical systems, waukesha, wisconsin, usa) were obtained from children using standard tech- niques. all data report the mean values. bmi was calcu- lated using cdc reference norms25 and waist (cm) to height (cm) ratio (whtr) was compared with recom- mendations from ashwell and hsieh.27 researchers 2 dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


plotted bp, bmi and whtr onto colour-coded charts relative to age and sex in a booklet that parents were able to take home. the booklet also included a glossary of key terms, a summary of the child’s lifestyle beha- viours (eg, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) as reported by parents, as well as current new zealand guidelines for these behaviours.28 feedback interview: researchers explained each measure and then discussed the lifestyle behaviours. bmi and whtr measurements were presented using a trafﬁc light approach to avoid labelling the child as ‘overweight’ or ‘obese’. implications of each colour zone were explained in terms of how many children were in each zone, pos- sible health consequences and the long-term risk of car- rying excess weight associated with each zone. researchers delivering the feedback were from different backgrounds (eg, dietetics, nutrition, exercise science). therefore, researchers delivering bpc feedback (n=2) received 6 h of general interviewing skills training and 6 h training on the feedback protocol. researchers deli- vering mi feedback (n=3) received approximately 40 h training in mi and the feedback protocol. bpc feedback condition: researchers gave generic advice about healthy lifestyles, meaning that the primary focus of the bpc interview was on anthropometric results and discussion of the lifestyle behaviours. interviews typically lasted 15 min. mi feedback condition: parents were given information using an elicit-provide-elicit (e-p-e) approach29 that allowed researchers to check in with parents’ prior knowledge before giving feedback. this approach also allowed parents the opportunity to explore the meaning and importance of the results. therefore, in contrast to the bpc interview, the focus of the mi interview was on the implications of the health check results to the family. interviews typically lasted 30 min. all interviews were videotaped and transcribed verbatim so that accuracy of recall could be determined. follow-up the recall interview took place approximately 2 weeks after the screening and feedback session and an inde- pendent interviewer (n=3), not involved in the feedback process, interviewed the parents. parents repeated aspects of the bmi screening questionnaire and com- pleted a semi-structured interview (questions are pre- sented in table 1). in summary, these assessed recall and usefulness of the information, and parental experience of the feedback. interviews lasted approximately 10– 15 min and were audio recorded and later transcribed for coding by a professional transcriber blinded to the feedback group. coding the number of pieces of information given at the feed- back session was identiﬁed and deﬁned by two authors (amd, dab). the ﬁrst phase of the coding was devel- oped a priori from the interview schedule, which was designed and developed prior to the study, based on the information we expected to elicit. the second phase of figure 1 participant flow throughout the study. dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


the coding, involving the development of speciﬁc codes and weightings, was developed after the data had been collected and the researchers had become familiar with the categories of responses that parents gave (see online supplementary table s1). lists of acceptable responses were developed and the coding framework was applied (initially collaboratively, then independently) to tran- scripts, and codes compared. discrepancies were resolved through discussion and the coding rules were ﬁnalised. the pieces of information (n=16), information categories (n=6) and deﬁnitions are presented in table 2. although 16 is a large number of discrete items of information to receive, the 6 categories were the main point of interest and the individual items were included to provide details on the type of information recalled. scores were weighted according to their importance in the feedback interview. weighting decisions were made through author discussion of the most important clinical messages delivered to parents. for example, the main result discussed was bmi; there- fore, this was allocated the highest weighting of 4 from a maximum of 12.5. only the weighted ﬁgures were used in analyses presented here, but results did not differ, whether weighted or unweighted scores were used (data not shown). coding was completed in two passes. the ﬁrst pass assessed how much information was recalled. coders iden- tiﬁed relevant statements on the transcript and allocated a score under one or more categories. one statement could be coded in several categories (eg, ‘her bmi was in the overweight category’ would gain a score for indicating that bmi was measured and for giving the bmi result). if a piece of information was mentioned more than once, only the ﬁrst statement was allocated a score. as recall table 1 recall interview questions free recall question 1. what information were you given about your child’s growth? non-specific prompts were you given any other information about your child at the initial session? tell me more about that… what information were you given? specific prompt for implications 2. what were you told that the information means for him/her? additional interview questions—prompted recall 3. how easy was it to follow and use the information presented in the health check booklet? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 very easy somewhat easy somewhat difficult very difficult 4. how useful did you find the information presented in the health check booklet? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 very useful somewhat useful not very useful not at all useful 5. how easy was it to understand and follow the explanations of terms (such as body mass index, blood pressure and waist to height ratio?) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 very difficult somewhat difficult somewhat easy very easy 6. how useful did you find the traffic light system (green, orange and red zones) to explain your child’s weight status? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 very useful somewhat useful not very useful not at all useful 7. how did you feel about the way the information about your child’s weight status was given to you? 8. i felt upset by the information given in the health check? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 not at all true somewhat true very true 9. i felt upset by the way the information was given in the health check? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 not at all true somewhat true very true 10. i felt it was useful to be given this information? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 not at all true somewhat true very true 11. the information about my child’s weight was unexpected? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 not at all true somewhat true very true 12. i’m interested in your decision to tell/not tell your child. 13. if you did discuss the information with your child, what did you tell them? 14. how did your child react to this information? 15. are there any other things we could do to improve the way our health check results are discussed with parents? or any other comments? 4 dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


may be prompted by discussion that occurs later in the interview, recall of the implications associated with carry- ing excess weight was divided by stage of interview, into free and prompted recall (table 1). recall of the other ﬁve information categories was not divided into free and prompted recall, as the majority of relevant information was recalled following question 1, and the interview was not set up to prompt exhaustively as would be expected in a memory interview. implications recalled in response to the ﬁrst recall question and non-speciﬁc prompts were considered free recall. implications recalled following a speciﬁc prompt or additional interview questions were considered prompted recall. the second coding pass identiﬁed whether the information recalled was accurate or not. each piece of information identiﬁed in the ﬁrst pass was compared with the transcript of the bmi feed- back interview (ie, what was really discussed) and coded as correct or incorrect. each recall interview transcript was coded by coder 1 (amd) and 25% (n=60) were coded by coder 2 (dab). amd also recoded a subset of the interviews (12%, n=30) to check for drift. κ values for inter- and intra-reliability were moderate to excellent30 (0.48–0.96). data analysis linear regression was conducted to examine the overall effects of interview condition, recall interviewer and time between feedback and recall interview. to examine the amount of information recalled, scores were con- verted to a proportion of the total number of items in each category and regression was used to compare the relative frequencies of information category (within- subjects factor) and the interaction of feedback condi- tion (between-subjects factor). accuracy was calculated as the number who correctly recalled the information from (1) just those who actually mentioned each type of information and (2) from all parents. thus accuracy for the former calculation reﬂects errors of commission, whereas using the total number of parents as the denominator also includes errors of omission. accuracy was analysed using a two-group difference in proportion test to detect any difference between the two feedback conditions. a mixed model was used to compare recall of the meaning of results by stage of interview (within- subjects factor) and feedback condition (between- subjects factor). the model included an interaction term to ﬁnd out whether the type of information (life- style changes vs implications) was different in the mi and bpc groups. to investigate which factors are asso- ciated with better recall, variables were analysed using multiple linear regression. variables with p<0.2 in the univariate model were included in the multivariate models. to adjust for feedback condition and time between feedback and recall session, these variables were also included in the multivariate models. data were also adjusted for clustering within families given that one family enrolled three overweight siblings and nine families enrolled two siblings. the larger mint study from which these data are derived is adequately powered, as it required a minimum of 250 participants to detect the main out- comes of interest, with a ﬁnal sample size of 271.24 no sample size calculations were performed prior to analysis for this paper, as it was a secondary data analysis. all data were analysed using stata v.13.1 (statacorp, college station, texas, usa). as missing data were less than 1.5% (43 of 2928 data points) we have presented analyses for the available data. results table 3 presents the characteristics of the overall sample and according to participation. parents who did not par- ticipate in recall interviews (n=27) had children who did not differ from children who did participate (n=244) in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, household deprivation, table 2 coding category definitions and possible scores coding categories definition total number of items total weighted score growth measurement recall of each measurement taken: height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index (bmi) and waist to height ratio (whtr). 5 2.5 growth concept recall reflecting knowledge or understanding of the concept of bmi— looking at a person’s weight in relation to their height (proportion) and whtr—a measure of how big they are around their waist, taking their height into consideration 2 1.5 growth result recall of child’s bmi and/or whtr result 2 4 growth implication recall of the implications of childhood overweight for health, severity of problem, long-term weight problems, the need to act 4 2 blood pressure recall that blood pressure was measured and the child’s blood pressure result 2 1.5 behavior recall of discussion of behavioural recommendations 1 1 total recall 16 12.5 bmi, body mass index; whtr, waist to height ratio. dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

implications that they were told when they were given their child’s bmi result. logistic regression demon- strated a signiﬁcant interaction between the type of information recalled (eg, bmi result) and feedback con- dition (bpc or mi) (p<0.01). further examination demonstrated that those in the bpc condition were more likely to report that lifestyle behaviours had been discussed (mean difference in score 0.27 from total pos- sible score of 1.0, 95% ci 0.14 to 0.40, p<0.01), whereas the implications of the bmi results were more likely to be reported by those in the mi condition (mean difference in score 0.14 from a total possible score of 2.0, 95% ci 0.01 to 0.27, p=0.02). table 5 also presents the proportion of parents who correctly recalled each type of information. as men- tioned 97% (n=238) of parents remembered their child had a high bmi and 97% (n=230) of these or 94% of parents overall were accurate in their recollection. parents recalled their child’s bp and whtr results less often (n=51–68 parents). estimates of accuracy were based on errors of commission (ie, parents who reported the information but did so incorrectly), of which 86–97% accurately recalled the information. when we included errors of omission (ie, parents who left the information out of their account), accuracy was substantially lower (19–25%). although the number of parents recalling what high bmi meant for their child (implications) was considerably lower, those parents who did recall implications were generally very accurate (ie, child was overweight and was more at risk of carrying this weight into adolescence), being correct 83–97% of the time. in contrast, the concept of bmi or whtr (ie, whether the child’s weight and height are in proportion, for their age) was poorly understood with only seven parents correctly recalling the concept of bmi and three parents correctly recalling whtr. interestingly, feedback condition made no difference to the accuracy of paren- tal recall. not surprisingly, there was signiﬁcantly higher recall of the meaning of results following prompting (mean difference 0.28 from a total possible score of 2, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.38, p<0.01). this was particularly apparent for those in the mi group who showed a larger increase in meaning recall after prompting (m=0.55, sd=0.45) than bpc (m=0.40, sd=0.41) (interaction term 0.14, 0.00 to 0.28, p=0.04). table 6 presents the models for the association between total recall scores and predictors of interest. as the univariate models demonstrated that both time between feedback and recall session (p=0.029) and feed- back condition (p=0.030) were signiﬁcantly related to total recall score, only the multivariate models are dis- cussed here. after adjustment for these two variables, mothers with a university education had higher recall scores (difference, 95% ci 0.76, 0.20 to 1.32) than less educated mothers, whereas no differences were observed for child ethnicity or bmi z-score, maternal age or maternal bmi. most variables of interest asso- ciated with the total recall score appeared to be related to the experience of the feedback process. having a larger discrepancy between perceived and actual weight was associated with lower recall scores (−0.44, −0.76 to table 5 parent recall of each type of information in the overall sample and by feedback condition total recall (%) correct recall* (%) correct recall† (%) information category total sample n=244 mi n=121 bpc n=123 total sample mi bpc total sample mi bpc results bmi result 238 (97) 119 (98) 119 (97) 230 (97) 115 (97) 115 (97) 230 (94) 115 (95) 115 (93) whtr result 68 (28) 30 (25) 38 (31) 61 (90) 26 (87) 35 (92) 61 (25) 26 (21) 35 (28) blood pressure 51 (21) 22 (18) 29 (24) 47 (92) 19 (86) 28 (97) 47 (19) 19 (17) 28 (23) meaning of results 0 implications recalled 37 (15) 11 (9) 26 (21) – – – – – – 1 implication recalled 92 (38) 47 (39) 45 (36) 85 (92) 43 (91) 42 (93) 85 (35) 43 (36) 42 (34) 2 implications recalled 75 (31) 40 (33) 35 (29) 67 (89) 38 (95) 29 (83) 67 (27) 38 (31) 29 (24) 3 or 4 implications recalled 40 (16) 23 (19) 17 (14) 33 (83) 19 (83) 14 (83) 33 (14) 19 (16) 14 (11) behaviour discussion 80 (33) 24 (20) 56 (46) – – – – – – concepts discussed bmi concept 63 (26) 21 (17) 42 (34) 7 (11) 3 (14) 4 (10) 7 (3) 3 (2) 4 (3) whtr concept 11 (5) 5 (4) 6 (5) 3 (27) 0 (0) 3 (50) 3 (0) 0 (0) 3 (2) figures shown are the frequency and percentages of parents who recalled each type of information overall and by feedback condition. for correct recall, percentages are calculated from *only from those who recalled the information (errors of omission) and †the total sample (errors of omission). bmi, body mass index; bpc, best practice care; mi, motivational interviewing; whtr, waist to height ratio. dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 7 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


−0.14). conversely, understanding the information pre- sented in the feedback process (0.29, 0.07 to 0.50) or ﬁnding it useful (0.20, 0.04 to 0.35) were both associated with higher recall scores to a similar degree. once all signiﬁcant variables were entered in multivariate model 2, only university maternal education (0.81, 0.25 to 1.37) and ﬁnding the information useful (0.19, 0.04 to 0.35) remained independent predictors of total recall score. discussion our study demonstrated that although parents were only able to recall 39% of the information that was given to them at the bmi screening session, virtually all (97%) recalled that their child was overweight. our ﬁndings are consistent with previous research demonstrating that while overall recall of medical information is poor,9 parents are good at recalling important details such as their child’s diagnosis15 or weight status.19 in contrast, information from other categories was not as readily reported and, in particular, concepts were poorly under- stood, with less than 50% of parents able to accurately describe what was done. these ﬁndings are consistent with the attentional narrowing hypothesis which suggests that the most salient information is attended to, leaving less attention for peripheral information.31 given the poor recognition of overweight in children, it is likely that receiving such feedback will elicit distress in some people, which may accentuate attentional narrowing.31 32 however, it is important to note that the child’s actual bmi was supported by a graph that parents were able to take home, and therefore may have aided recall of the key results, similar to bmi screening studies, which provide results in a letter that parents are able to refer back to. in contrast, the meaning of the bmi result was dis- cussed in the session but was not supported by a take home message. while the provision of take home written information to aid recall of medical information has pro- duced inconsistent results,7 there is some evidence to suggest that simple pictorial messages can aid recall.33 it is also important to note that unfamiliar concepts (such as the waist to height ratio measurement) were also sup- ported by a take home visual and yet were poorly recalled. this may suggest that a take home message may not be sufﬁcient to promote recall of unfamiliar concepts. furthermore, in contrast to typical healthcare appoint- ments, the feedback was given in an environment that minimised distractions (eg, the presence of the child or other siblings), potentially optimising the ability of parents to process the information being communicated. findings from the current study suggest that parents have limited capacity for processing a large amount of information and although they are able to remember some key pieces of information (that their child was overweight), important details were forgotten (such as why being an overweight child is a concern). while it table 6 models for the association between total recall and predictors of interest variable univariate model (95% ci) multivariate model 1 (95% ci) multivariate model 2 (95% ci) maternal education tertiary† 0.30 (−0.25 to 0.86) 0.30 (−0.25 to 0.84) 0.30 (−0.30 to 0.85) university degree† 0.82 (0.27 to 1.38)* 0.76 (0.20 to 1.32)* 0.81 (0.25 to 1.37)* ethnicity maori‡ −0.61 (−1.17 to −0.05)* −0.52 (−1.09 to 0.04) pacific‡ −0.30 (−1.10 to 0.51) −0.30 (−1.08 to 0.48) maternal bmi −0.01 (−0.05 to 0.02) −0.01 (−0.04 to 0.02) maternal age 0.02 (−0.02, 0.06) 0.02 (−0.02 to 0.06) child bmi (z-score) 0.19 (−0.31 to 0.71) 0.12 (−0.37 to 0.61) parental concern before feedback 0.27 (0.06 to 0.47)* 0.20 (−0.01 to 0.42) 0.10 (−0.13 to 0.33) discrepancy between perceived and actual weight −0.52 (−0.84 to −0.21)* −0.44 (−0.76 to −0.14)* −0.23 (−0.58 to 0.11) weight information unexpected −0.10 (−0.19 to −0.002)* −0.09 (−0.18 to 0.01) −0.03 (−0.13 to 0.07) understand information presented in hc booklet 0.28 (0.06 to 0.49)* 0.29 (0.07 to 0.50)* 0.19 (−0.04 to 0.42) usefulness of information presented in hc booklet 0.22 (0.07 to 0.37)* 0.20 (0.04 to 0.35)* 0.19 (0.04 to 0.35)* time between feedback and recall session (days) −0.03 (−0.05 to −0.004)* −0.02 (−0.04 to 0.01) feedback condition 0.48 (0.05 to 0.92)* 0.28 (−0.18 to 0.73) β estimates refer to the difference in total recall weighted score (from possible of 12.5) explained by each predictor of interest. multivariate model 1 estimates are adjusted for time between feedback and recall interview and feedback condition. multivariate model 2 estimates are adjusted for all other variables in the model. *p<0.05. †reference group was some secondary school. ‡reference group was new zealand european and others. bmi, body mass index; hc, health check. 8 dawson am, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004481. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004481 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


could be argued that six categories of information is an unrealistic target, a considerable amount of time was spent within the interviews on bmi and what it means for health; more than would be spent during a typical primary care consultation. this has important implica- tions for including bmi screening within routine health- care, especially if the information is unexpected. thus, health professionals need to limit the amount of infor- mation given in one session, provide personalised take- home information, or use multiple sessions to assess gaps in patient recall or understanding and provide clariﬁcation, especially if the information is unexpected or includes unfamiliar concepts. despite our best efforts to present information to promote optimal recall and understanding7 (spending a signiﬁcant portion of time on the key message (bmi and health), providing pictorial information and providing simple non-technical explanations),7 our ﬁndings suggest that the implications were poorly recalled and concepts were poorly understood. while a diagnosis is important, it is not meaningful without an understand- ing of the implications and a clear treatment pathway. this is particularly relevant in primary care, where doctors are often reluctant34 to discuss childhood over- weight and unsure how to communicate this informa- tion to families.35 this may inadvertently lead to ambiguous information or brief communication, making it easy for parents to become confused about the mes- sages they are being given, particularly if the information conﬂicts with parental beliefs. poor understanding also has implications for the transfer of this information beyond the direct medical setting and into the child’s wider context. for example, if parents are unable to understand what their child’s results mean, there is the potential for miscommunication with signiﬁcant people in the child’s life who might need to be involved in changing lifestyle factors. literature examining parental recall of child weight status information is very limited19 20 36 and no studies appear to have assessed recall and understanding of bmi information and related concepts following a tar- geted face-to-face interview. johnson and colleagues19 investigated parent reactions to a screening programme and included measures of recall of the information pro- vided in a bmi results letter. consistent with the current study, important information was recalled well (eg, 94% of the parents recalled their child’s weight category), and other details were less likely to be recalled (eg, mea- surements). however, reports of parental accuracy were lower than those observed in the current study. this may have arisen because of different methods of informing parents (letter vs face-to-face) or due to the more strin- gent accuracy classiﬁcation used by johnson et al.19 although it may seem surprising that parents receiving bpc feedback were able to remember more than those who received mi, more structured and speciﬁc information is more likely to be remembered.7 37 the bpc interview was highly structured and the advice given to parents to achieve lifestyle guidelines was very speciﬁc (eg, change high fat to low fat milk), whereas the mi session, reﬂecting the intention of mi,38 was not structured, with research assistants intentionally avoiding giving speciﬁc advice. as the mi sessions were twice as long as the bpc sessions, it is also possible that the additional time spent on the explor- ation of the meaning and implication of results took focus away from the central details of the message, resulting in lower recall of the information. higher maternal education was related to improved overall recall, consistent with the literature in other health contexts.7 14 while a relationship between recall and child and maternal bmi,19 ethnicity19 and age39 have previously been suggested, they were unrelated in this study. here, beliefs about weight played a more important role: parents who found the information unexpected or did not understand the feedback process or ﬁnd it useful, had lower recall. in contrast, those who were already concerned about their child’s weight had higher overall recall. these ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that memory is heightened for information that is consistent with one’s current beliefs40 and has implications for health practitioners giving parents results that they may not expect. prior to delivering feed- back, health practitioners may beneﬁt from assessing parents’ expectations, concerns and current knowledge, to assist in prioritising and explaining results that may not align with these. this study examined recall and understanding in a large sample of families with overweight children. this study was not originally constructed to assess parental memory, and as such it was not set up to exhaustively prompt parents for complete recall. it is possible that had we interviewed dif- ferently, parents may have recalled more information. however, much of the information used in this interview was based on free recall, which is particularly relevant in this context as it likely reﬂects the information that is most salient and easily accessible to parents. in summary, our ﬁndings appear to be the ﬁrst to examine parental recall of bmi and growth information following a bmi screening and face-to-face feedback session. while our results suggest that parents were able to remember their child’s overweight diagnosis very well, 61% of the information was forgotten. this ﬁnding sug- gests that the inclusion of bmi screening within current appointments may negatively impact parental ability to remember and understand this information. in addition, the way that the information is given, and parental edu- cation, values and expectations, were associated with recall of the information and therefore suggest that health professionals need to be aware of these factors when discussing results with parents. author affiliations 1department of women’s and children’s health, dunedin school of medicine, university of otago, dunedin, new
