ed can have vasculogenic, neurogenic, anatomical, hormonal, drug-induced or psychogenic aetiologies.5 various therapies are available for ed: orally adminis- tered phosphodiesterase type-5 (pde-5) inhibitors, intra- cavernosal injection of vasoactive agents and transurethral delivery of alprostadil, vacuum constriction devices and penile prostheses.6 testosterone can be given to patients with ed with hypogonadism.7 ed is more prevalent in men with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (or 1.45; 95% ci 1.16 to 1.81) and diabetes mellitus (dm; or 3.13; 95% ci 2.35 to 4.16).8 a community health survey conducted in boston (massachusetts, usa) reported that the prevalence of patients with ed with heart disease, dm, hypertension and obesity was 52.3%, 49.3%, 35.4% and 23.5%, respectively.9 ed is also associated with lifestyle factors such as physical activity, smoking and alcohol consump- tion (p<0.01).9 a cross-sectional survey conducted in malaysia found that a larger proportion of patients with ed had hypertension (58.7%), followed by dm (40.9%), hyperlipidaemia (35.5%), obesity (13.1%) and heart disease (8.3%).4 pde-5 inhibitors such as sildenaﬁl, vardenaﬁl and tadalaﬁl are ﬁrst-line therapies for ed with proven safety and efﬁ- cacy.10 various studies showed that pde-5 inhibitors improve the erectile function in men with comorbidities such as hypertension, dm and hyperlipidaemia.11 in 2011, the food and drug administration (fda) in the usa approved tada- laﬁl as a treatment for the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and ed if both conditions occur simultaneously.12 however, there is a risk of hypoten- sion if pde-5 inhibitors are administered with α-blockers.10 hence, factors such as comorbidities and concurrent medi- cation can affect the selection of pde-5 inhibitors. studies on the characteristics of patients with ed and the factors associated with the selection of drug treat- ment in malaysia are lacking. we aimed to overcome this hiatus in the present study. patients and methods study design and setting this was a cross-sectional retrospective study conducted at the university of malaya medical center (ummc; malaysia), a teaching hospital with 1000 beds. approval from the medical committee of ummc (reference number: 956.33) was obtained before the study was carried out. study population and sampling frame the study involved patients diagnosed with ed with any comorbidity who had received a pde-5 inhibitor as a treatment option for ed. the sampling frame was from february 2012 to january 2013. the sampling size required was calculated using epi info program ver7.0. the level of signiﬁcance (α) was set as 0.05 and the desired power of the study (1−β) was 80%. assuming that the expected proportion of patients with ed was 69.5%4 and the conﬁdence limit 5%, the minimum sample size was calculated to be 139 patients. study procedures a total of 309 registration number (r/n) patients pre- scribed with sildenaﬁl, tadalaﬁl or vardenaﬁl from february 2012 to january 2013 were generated from the pharmacy information system (pis). sampling was con- ducted to include patients as the study sample. a total of 286 (92.6%) medication records and case notes were retrieved from the patient medical record (pmr) ofﬁce. the inclusion criteria were adult patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with ed and prescribed with silde- naﬁl, tadalaﬁl or vardenaﬁl. the exclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with ed but who did not receive any pde-5 inhibitor, or those with missing data. data collection data included demographic information (eg, age, ethni- city, height, weight, body mass index (bmi)). clinical characteristics (eg, duration of ed, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, medication regimen, laboratory results) were also recorded. definitions used in the study ▸ ‘comorbidities’ were deﬁned as coexisting ailments that required long-term therapy.13 ▸ ‘elderly’ was deﬁned as patients aged ≥65 years.14 ▸ ‘normal weight’ was deﬁned as a bmi (in kg/m2) of 18.5–22.9, ‘overweight’ as 23–27.4 and ‘obesity’ as ≥27.5.15 ▸ ‘sudden onset’ was deﬁned as the early detumes- cence of erection during sexual intercourse but main- tenance of a normal nocturnal erection. ‘gradual onset’ was deﬁned as the slow progression of ed with weakening of erection rigidity.16 ▸ ‘pharmacological causes’ were deﬁned as the use of medications such as antihypertensive agents that can cause ed.17 ▸ ‘psychological causes’ were deﬁned as an ability to have an erection in some circumstances but not in others due to performance anxiety, stress or depression.17 ▸ ‘medical causes’ were deﬁned as ed due to medical conditions such as dm or hypertension.17 ▸ ‘surgical causes’ were deﬁned as ed due to surgery, irradiation or procedures that involved the prostate gland, bladder, colon, rectum, spinal cord or brain.17 ▸ ‘hormonal causes’ were deﬁned as ed due to a decrease in serum testosterone levels.17 statistical methods all the data collected and extracted were analysed using spss ver21 (spss, chicago, illinois, usa). normally dis- tributed data were expressed as frequency and mean±sd. non-normally distributed data were expressed as median and iqrs. categorical data (eg, patient characteristics, comorbidities) were expressed as percentages. the associ- ation or correlation of patient characteristics with ed was 2 zaman huri h, lian choo t, sulaiman cz, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005381. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005381 open access

prevalence of ihd in elderly patients was reported to be 19.8%.18 in malaysia in 2006, ihd was the second leading cause of death (15.5% of individuals who died in government hospitals).19 the men’s attitudes to life events and sexuality (males) study (27 839 participants) found that men with ihd had a higher prevalence of ed.20 endothelial dysfunction causes a reduction in the level of nitric oxide (no), which is responsible for muscle relaxation in the penis, and might be the mechanism that links ihd and ed.21 the table 4 association of pde-5 inhibitors with comorbidities and concurrent medication comorbidities/medications sildenafil (n=143) number of patients (%) vardenafil (n=39) p valuetadalafil (n=37) hypertension 0.852† yes 79 (55.2) 22 (59.5) 23 (59.0) no 64 (44.8) 15 (49.5) 16 (41.0) diabetes mellitus 0.073† yes 68 (47.6) 22 (59.5) 13 (33.3) no 75 (52.4) 15 (40.5) 26 (66.7) hyperlipidaemia 0.607† yes 76 (53.1) 17 (45.9) 18 (46.2) no 67 (46.9) 20 (54.1) 21 (53.8) obesity 0.795† yes 31 (39.7) 6 (50.0) 6 (40.0) no 47 (60.3) 6 (50.0) 9 (60.0) depression 0.304‡ yes 3 (2.1) 2 (5.4) 2 (5.1) no 140 (97.9) 35 (94.6) 37 (94.9) ihd 0.257‡ yes 15 (10.5) 1(2.7) 5 (12.8) no 128 (89.5) 36 (97.3) 34 (87.2) bph 0.449† yes 38 (26.6) 9 (24.3) 14 (35.9) no 105 (73.4) 28 (75.7) 25 (64.1) luts 0.038‡ yes 11 (7.7) 4 (10.8) 9 (23.1) no 132 (92.3) 33 (89.2) 30 (76.9) diabetic agents 0.084† oral agents 52 (36.4) 15 (40.5) 17 (17.9) insulin 3 (2.1) 0 (0.0) 3 (7.7) insulin and oral agents 11 (7.7) 5 (13.5) 3 (7.7) no 77 (53.8) 17 (45.9) 26 (66.7) antihypertensive agents 0.417† yes 91 (63.6) 23 (62.2) 29 (74.4) no 52 (36.4) 14 (37.8) 10 (25.6) lipid lowering agents 0.477† yes 78 (54.5) 19 (51.4) 25 (64.1) no 65 (45.5) 18 (48.6) 14 (35.9) antiplatelet agents 0.413† yes 29 (20.3) 4 (10.8) 7 (17.9) no 114 (79.7) 33 (89.2) 32 (82.1) antidepressants 0.120‡ yes 3 (2.1) 2 (5.4) 3 (7.7) no 140 (97.9) 35 (94.6) 36 (92.3) bronchodilator agents 0.120‡ yes 3 (2.1) 2 (5.4) 3 (7.7) no 140 (97.9) 35 (94.6) 36 (92.3) α-blockers 0.008† yes 31 (21.7) 17 (43.6) 6 (16.2) no 112 (78.3) 22 (56.4) 31 (83.8) *statistically significant (p<0.05). †computed using pearson’s χ2. ‡computed using fisher’s exact test. bph, benign prostatic hyperplasia; ihd, ischaemic heart disease; luts, lower urinary tract symptom. 6 zaman huri h, lian choo t, sulaiman cz, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005381. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005381 open access


arterial size hypothesis is based on an association between ed and chronic heart disease.22 this hypothesis suggests that obstruction of the penile artery precedes obstruction of the coronary artery.22 if so, ed can be used to predict the risk of ihd (one retrospective study showed that ed appeared ﬁrst in 71% of patients).23 hence, elderly patients with ihd should be aware of the risk of ed. there was a signiﬁcant association between bph and being an elderly patient with ed (p<0.001). in malaysia, the prevalence of bph is >50% in men aged ≥60 years.24 bph is usually associated with a series of luts, including nocturia, increased urinary hesitancy, frequency and urgency, as well as a weak dribbling stream of urine and increased postvoiding residual volumes.25 several studies have indicated that bph with asso- ciated luts increased incidence of ed.20 26 medications used in bph treatment may affect normal erectile function.21 the contradictory facts of improving versus disrupting erectile function were not well under- stood; however, at least one study has shown that the use of α-blockers may cause ed.27 the use of 5α- reductase inhibitors has been associated with decreased erectile function due to low levels of no and thus related to a decline in dihydrotestosterone levels.28 other than drugs, surgery for treatment of ed may also affect erect- ile function. for instance, one of the long-term compli- cations of transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) in patients with bph is ed. one study found that 12% of patients with ed underwent turp for bph.29 thus, elderly patients with bph should be aware of the risk of ed. being elderly and having ed was found to be asso- ciated with obesity (p=0.005). according to the third national health and morbidity survey, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in elderly patients in malaysia is 29.2%.30 another study conducted in the rural area of selangor in malaysia found that the prevalence of obesity in patients aged ≥60 years was 9.3%.31 in the health professionals follow-up study (22 086 partici- pants in the usa), obesity was found to increase the risk of ed compared with an ideal bmi (relative risk 1.9; ci 1.6 to 2.2).32 several mechanisms could link ed with obesity. first, visceral obesity induces an inﬂammatory response that can lead to endothelial dysfunction.33 second, obesity and associated comorbidities such as the metabolic syndrome can cause a lower level of testoster- one in plasma that can lead to hypogonadism.33 this hypothesis is supported by a study involving 2435 men with ed which found that obesity was associated with lower levels of testosterone in the body.34 conversely, one study showed that physical activity and weight reduc- tion improved erectile function in one-third of obese men with ed.35 thus, obesity is a modiﬁable risk factor that can prevent or improve the outcome of ed. luts were commonly present in elderly patients with ed. one study in a tertiary hospital in malaysia found that the prevalence of moderate-to-severe luts was 42.7% in men aged ≥40 years.36 several studies have established the relationship between ed and luts. for example, a local population-based survey found that men with moderate and severe luts had a 1.4-times increased risk of getting ed.37 a prospective study con- ducted in ﬁve asian countries involving 916 patients reported ed in 80% of patients with luts.38 that study also found a reduction of international index of erectile function (iief)-5 scores with increasing age.38 also, a survey conducted in the usa and six european coun- tries found that 90% of 12 815 patients had luts, and that 83% of patients were sexually active.39 nevertheless, ed was present in almost half of the patients who had luts.39 a possible explanation for this association is a reduction in no levels in the penis and prostate muscle.40 hence, because of evidence showing an associ- ation between luts and ed, elderly patients should be assessed for sexual function during luts management. only α-blockers were signiﬁcantly associated with elderly patients with ed. α-blockers are used mainly for bph treatment or as adjunct therapy if blood pressure is not well controlled.3 41 42 in malaysia, the prevalence of bph is >50% in men aged >60 years.24 α-blockers such as tamsulosin used in bph have been found to have a negative impact on erectile function27 but alfuzosin has been reported to have a positive impact on erectile func- tion in experimental models.43 thus, caution with the use of α-blockers in elderly patients with ed is needed. there was a signiﬁcant association between luts and drug selection. evidence-based guidelines on the selec- tion of pde-5 inhibitors in patients with ed with differ- ent comorbidities are lacking. the distribution of luts was higher for vardenaﬁl, followed by tadalaﬁl and silde- naﬁl. one study in animals investigating the efﬁcacy of pde-5 inhibitors for luts treatment found that, com- pared with tadalaﬁl and sildenaﬁl, vardenaﬁl was the most potent drug for the relaxation of prostate and urethral tissue.44 additionally, we previously found that vardenaﬁl and tadalaﬁl could inhibit proliferation of stromal cells in the prostate gland and hence prevent enlargement of the prostate gland.44 tadalaﬁl is the only drug approved by the fda for treatment of the signs and symptoms of bph (speciﬁcally known as luts).12 this could be the reason behind the greater usage of vardenaﬁl and tadalaﬁl in patients with luts: they can be used for the treatment for ed and luts. patients who took 5 mg of tadalaﬁl reported a signiﬁcant improvement in symptoms of ed and bph.45 there was a signiﬁcant association between the α-blockers and the type of pde-5 inhibitor. the com- bined treatment can promote an improvement in both psychometric parameters of voiding dysfunction (namely, international prostate symptom score (ipss) scores) and ed (namely, iief-ef), and a signiﬁcant amelioration of the qmax.46 47 the distribution was higher in tadalaﬁl, followed by sil- denaﬁl and vardenaﬁl. tadalaﬁl has been shown to elicit zaman huri h, lian choo t, sulaiman cz, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005381. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005381 7 open access


the least signiﬁcant reduction in blood pressure when taken with a uroselective or non-uroselective α-blocker.48 in contrast, a greater reduction in blood pressure has been noted if sildenaﬁl is given together with an α-blocker.49 the combination of vardenaﬁl and an α-blocker resulted in an increased prevalence of hypo- tension compared with the placebo group in one study.50 this could be the reason behind the higher usage of tadalaﬁl with the α-blocker in the present study. conclusion ed was prevalent in men aged ≥50 years. patients with ed often had comorbidities such as hypertension, dm and hyperlipidaemia. ihd, bph, obesity and luts were associated with elderly patients with ed. thus, elderly patients with these diseases should be aware of the risk of ed. the presence of luts and α-blockers was signiﬁ- cantly associated with the selection of pde-5 inhibitor. hence, further studies on the combinations of α-blockers and pde-5 inhibitors are required to develop more effective pharmacological management of luts and ed. contributors hzh and ahar have made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study. hzh has been involved in acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data and drafting of the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content. tlc, czs and rm have been involved in acquisition of data and analysis and interpretation. hzh, tlc, czs, rm and ahar have given final approval to the version to be published. funding the authors would like to thank the ministry of science, technology and innovation, malaysia (science fund: 12-02-03-2097) and university of malaya, malaysia (university of malaya research grant: rg428/12htm) for financial and technical support. competing interests none. ethics approval medical ethics committee, university of malaya medical centre. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement no additional data are available. open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the creative commons attribution non commercial (cc by-nc 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non- commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ references 1. national institutes of health. consensus statement on impotence. int j impot res 1992;10:1–33. 2. lizza ef, rosen rc. definition and classification of erectile dysfunction: report of the nomenclature committee of the international society of the international society of impotence research. int j impot res 1999;11:141. 3. saigal cs, wessells h, pace j, et al. predictors and prevalance of erectile dysfunction in a racially diverse population. arch inter med 2006;166:207–12. 4. ab rahman aa, al-sada n, low wy. prevalence of erectile dysfunction in primary care setting, malaysia. j mens health 2011;8: s50–3. 5. wespes e, amar e, hatzichristou d, et al. eau guidelines on erectile dysfunction: an update. eur urol 2006;49:806–15. 6. montague dk, jarow jp, broderick ga, et al. chapter 1: the management of erectile dysfunction: an aua update. j urol 2005;174:230–9. 7. shabsigh r. hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction: the role of testosterone therapy. int j impot res 2003;15(s4):s9–13. 8. grover sa, lowensteyn l, kaouache m, et al. the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in the primary care setting: importance of risk factors for diabetes and vascular disease. arch inter med 2006;166:213–19. 9. kupelian v, araujo ab, chiu gr, et al. relative contributions of modifiable risk factors to erectile dysfunction: results from the boston area community health (bach) survey. prevent med 2010;50:19–25. 10. hatzimouratidis k, amat e, eardley i, et al.
