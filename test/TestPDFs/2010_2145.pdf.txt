 2 abstract  background   while several recent large randomized trials found clinically relevant effects of acupuncture  over no treatment or routine care, blinded trials comparing acupuncture to sham  interventions often reported only minor or no differences. this raises the question whether  (sham) acupuncture is associated with particularly potent non-specific effects. we aimed to  investigate the size of non-specific effects associated with acupuncture interventions.    methods   medline, embase, cochrane central register of controlled clinical trials, and reference lists  were searched up to april 2010 to identify randomized trials of acupuncture for any condition  including both a sham and a no acupuncture control group. data were extracted by one  reviewer and verified by a second. pooled standardized mean differences were calculated  using a random effects model with the inverse variance method.    results   37 trials with a total of 5754 patients met the inclusion criteria. the included studies varied  strongly regarding patients, interventions, outcome measures, methodological quality and  effect sizes reported. among the 32 trials reporting a continuous outcome measure the  random effects standardized mean difference between sham acupuncture and no  acupuncture groups was -0.45 (95%ci -0.57, -0.34; i² = 54%, egger’s test for funnel plot  asymmetry p = 0.25). trials with larger effects of sham over no acupuncture reported smaller  effects of acupuncture over sham intervention than trials with smaller non-specific effects (β  = -0.39, p = 0.029).    conclusions   sham acupuncture interventions are often associated with moderately large non-specific  effects, which could make it difficult to detect small additional specific effects. compared to 


 3 inert placebo interventions effects associated with sham acupuncture might be larger, which  would have considerable implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. 


 4 background    in recent years there is increasing evidence from large randomized trials and systematic  reviews showing that patients receiving acupuncture report better outcomes than patients  receiving no treatment or usual care only (for example [1-2]). a large trial on low back pain  [1] and a meta-analysis of migraine trials [2] even found superiority over guideline-oriented  conventional care. at the same time many recent high quality trials comparing true  acupuncture with a sham acupuncture intervention found only minor or even no differences  (see [2-5] for systematic reviews). the interpretation of this evidence is controversial. some  authors argue that the effects over no treatment and usual care are only due to usual  placebo effects and bias [3]. some authors argue that most sham acupuncture interventions  are physiologically active [4-5] and others that sham acupuncture interventions might be  associated with particularly potent non-specific or placebo effects [6-7].  treatment effects are considered specific if they are attributable solely to the – according to  the theory of the mechanism of action - characteristic component of an intervention [8-9].  effects which are associated with the incidental elements of an intervention are considered  non-specific effects (syn. placebo effects). non-specific effects are mostly thought to be due  to psychobiological processes triggered by the overall therapeutic context [10]. they have to  be distinguished from the natural course of disease, regression to the mean, the effects of  being in a study, co-interventions and, as far as possible, from reporting and other biases  [11-12]. the total effect of an intervention consists of both specific and non-specific effects  [13].   separating characteristic and incidental elements of an intervention is straightforward in  pharmacology but is difficult in other interventions such as psychotherapy [14]. acupuncture  involves the insertion and manipulation of needles into defined points of the body. while a  variety of mechanistic models exist the exact mechanism of action is unclear [15]. this  makes it difficult to devise a placebo intervention which is both inert and indistinguishable,  and reliably separates specific and non-specific effects. the frequent use of the word sham 


 5 intervention instead of placebo partly reflects this problem. sham interventions in clinical  trials of acupuncture typically vary from “true” acupuncture in one or both of the following  aspects [16]: location of points (for example, stimulation of non-indicated points or outside of  known points) and skin penetration (for example, use of fixed telescope “placebo” needles  with a blunt tip). if some or most of these sham interventions should indeed be  physiologically active such trials would not compare acupuncture to a placebo but to an  active intervention making it more difficult to detect significant differences.  this problem would also apply if (sham) acupuncture would be associated with more potent  placebo effects than other interventions. both invasive and non-invasive sham acupuncture  interventions exert (like true acupuncture) mild painful stimuli. it has been hypothesized that  such interventions might trigger enhanced placebo effects by simultaneously acting on a  sensory, cognitive and emotional level [7]. there is also evidence that the same sham  acupuncture intervention can have quite different effects when provided in different contexts  [17]. placebo research indicates that in many situations the therapeutic context associated  with an intervention matters more than the placebo intervention itself [20-21]. the therapeutic  context is depending not only on the specific therapeutic ritual applied but also on  experiences, attitudes and preferences of patients and providers, on the patient-provider  interaction, the setting and the cultural background [6]. given the positive attitudes and  expectation towards complementary therapies it seems possible that complex rituals such as  acupuncture could provoke significant psychobiological responses.  the most straightforward way to investigate whether sham acupuncture is associated with  larger effects than a pharmacological placebo would be in randomized trials including both  these interventions. the only trial using such an approach indeed found a significant  superiority of sham acupuncture [18]. another, albeit methodologically weaker, possibility is  to compare differences between sham acupuncture interventions and no treatment control  groups in acupuncture trials with those of (other) placebos and no treatment control groups in  other trials. hrobjartsson and gøtzsche have repeatedly reviewed all available trials including  both a placebo or sham and a no treatment group for any condition [19-21]. the latest 


 6 update of their cochrane review includes a total of 234 trials. in a pre-planned subgroup  analysis they found that studies using “physical placebos” (including sham acupuncture)  reported larger placebo effects (standardized mean difference (smd) -0.31; 95%-confidence  interval (ci) -0.41, -0.22) than studies using “pharmacological placebos” (smd -0.10; 95%ci  -0.20, -0.01) [21]. in a re-analysis of their data we separated the trials in which the physical  placebo was sham acupuncture from those which used other physical placebos. effects  sizes were significantly larger in trials using sham acupuncture than in trials using other  physical placebos (smds -0.41 (-0.56, -0.24) vs. -0.26 (-0.37, -0.15); p = 0.007) [22].  the cochrane review and our re-analysis of these data did not include a number of recent  rigorous, large acupuncture trials which include both a sham and a no treatment group.  furthermore, these reviews did not investigate whether large non-specific effects might make  it difficult to detect specific effects. therefore, we have performed a systematic review of  acupuncture trials in any condition including both a sham and a no treatment group published  until april 2010. our primary aim was to investigate the size of non-specific effects of  acupuncture (difference sham acupuncture vs. no acupuncture). our secondary aims were to  investigate factors (such as type of sham intervention, condition, study quality, or intensity of  co-interventions) possibly influencing the size of such non-specific effects and to quantify  specific (difference acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture) and total effects of acupuncture  (difference acupuncture vs. no acupuncture) in the included trials.     methods  selection criteria  to be included studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) design – trials in which  allocation to groups was explicitly randomized; (2) participants – persons treated for any  illness or for preventative purposes. trials in healthy volunteers measuring physiological  outcomes were excluded; (3) intervention – insertion of needles described as acupuncture at  acupuncture points, pain or trigger points with or without stimulation. trials on interventions  without skin penetration (e.g. laser acupuncture) were excluded; (4) sham intervention – 


 7 interventions described as sham, placebo, dummy or fake treatment which differed from true  acupuncture at least in one of two key aspects (skin penetration or point location); (5) no  acupuncture control group – there had to be a second control group in which participants  received neither true nor sham acupuncture. participants could be either completely  untreated or receive treatments which were also received in the true and sham acupuncture  groups (e.g. rescue medication, basic treatment or routine care); (6) outcomes – any clinical  outcomes for which the calculation of an effect size estimate was considered possible.     data sources and searches  for identifying potentially relevant studies we searched medline (from 1966 to april 2010),  embase (from 1988 to april 2010) for all sham-controlled trials of acupuncture (see appendix  for detailed search strategies): furthermore, we searched the cochrane central register of  controlled trials using a search strategy based on a cochrane review of randomized trials  with placebo and no treatment controls in all medicine [20]. while chinese trials identified by  our search were eligible, we did not specific chinese databases. one reviewer screened  titles and abstracts of all references identified and excluded those which were clearly  irrelevant. full texts of all remaining articles were obtained and assessed independently for  eligibility by two reviewers. disagreements or uncertainties were resolved by discussion.    data extraction and quality assessment  one reviewer extracted information on the following aspects from included studies using a  standard form: diagnosis, recruitment, number and type of study centres, number and types  of intervention and control groups, details on acupuncture and sham interventions, how  patients were informed about these, qualification of acupuncturists, co-interventions, study  duration, number of patients randomized, analyzed and dropping out (per group), age,  gender, results on the main outcome measures, important secondary outcomes and  responder data. a second reviewer checked all extractions of study results against the  original publications. trials were considered to have lower risk of bias if they reported an 


 8 adequate method of randomization concealment and had a drop-out rate below 15% [23].  for our main analyses we used the following strategy to choose the outcome: 1) it should be  a continuous outcome (mean and standard deviation available, or the standard deviation  could be calculated from standard errors, confidence intervals etc.; we did not impute  standard deviations for studies without available data on variability or precision); 2) the timing  should be as close as possible to the completion of treatment; 3) when there was a clearly  predefined main outcome measure we chose this measure (but always preferred the  measurement at the end of treatment over other time points or change from baseline); 4)  when there was no predefined single main outcome measure two reviewers independently  chose the outcome considered most important (two disagreements were resolved by  discussion). 5) if available, we used intention to treat data; otherwise we used the data as  presented in the publication. if a trial had more than one intervention (for example, an  individualized and a standardized intervention) or sham group the data was pooled. for more  recent studies we tried to contact authors inquiring for further information if data for meta- analysis were missing.    data synthesis and analysis  the cochrane collaboration’s review manager (revman) 5 software was used for meta- analyses. three comparisons were investigated: sham acupuncture vs. no acupuncture  (primary comparison), acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture, and acupuncture vs. no  acupuncture. studies were categorized into the clinical categories chronic pain studies, short  term studies (studies with an observation period of less than three days) and other studies.   the main analysis was based on trials reporting a continuous outcome measure using the  standardized mean difference (smds; difference between the means/pooled standard  deviation) as effect size estimate. as we assumed that studies would be clinically  heterogeneous a random effects model with the inverse variance method was used for meta- analysis. negative smds indicate a beneficial effect of sham acupuncture over no  acupuncture, acupuncture over sham acupuncture and acupuncture over no acupuncture, 


 9 respectively. smds ≤ -0.4 were considered small effects, those between -0.41 and -0.7  moderate and those > -0.7 large effects [24]. to investigate statistical heterogeneity revman  5 uses tau², chi² and i². we considered i²-values between 30% and 60% as indicating  moderate heterogeneity and higher values as indicating substantial heterogeneity. subgroup  comparisons were performed using the method by deeks et al. [25] implemented in revman  5. egger’s test was used to assess funnel plot asymmetry [26].   to check the robustness of results we performed sensitivity analyses a) including three- armed studies which had been excluded as they did not meet all inclusion criteria but still  could be considered addressing the questions investigated in this review (“borderline”  studies; see results); b) using different outcomes for studies with more than one relevant  outcome at completion of treatment; c) using dichotomous outcome measures (with a relative  risk < 1 indicating a beneficial effect).   for exploratory analyses we defined further subgroups: larger (at least 100 patients) and  smaller (< 100 patients) comparisons, lower and higher risk of bias (see above); studies with  intense or less intense co-interventions in all study arms; with and without skin penetration  (and depending on where needles were placed) in sham groups; studies with and without a  clearly defined main outcome measure; and studies describing sham in the consent  procedure as another treatment or placebo. in multivariate random effects meta-regression  analyses we investigated simultaneously the influence of risk of bias, co-interventions, skin  penetration in the sham group and condition (chronic pain vs. others). analyses were carried  out using the restricted information maximum likelihood (reml) method. for meta- regression analyses the pasw (spss; chicago, illinois) v17.0 and 18.0 software using  additional macros by wilson was used [27]. to investigate the hypothesis that there is an  inverse correlation between specific and non-specific effects (trials with large non-specific  effects are less likely to find large specific effects than trials with small non-specific effects)  we performed a linear regression analysis using the inverse of the squared pooled standard  error as weighting factor.   


 10 results  literature search and selection  the literature search identified a total of 1854 references of which 1779 were excluded in the  screening process as they clearly did not meet inclusion criteria (see figure 1). the full text of  the remaining 75 references was formally assessed for eligibility. a total of 37 studies [28-64]  met the inclusion criteria. eleven additional publications reported protocols or treatment  details of trials included in the review or reported the same results in another language (see  web appendix table 1). eighteen articles did not meet inclusion criteria and two were  protocols of ongoing trials (see web appendix table 2). two abstracts reported minimal  information on probably eligible trials including results for a dichotomous outcome [65-66];  attempts to obtain further information from the authors were unsuccessful. in four further  studies patients in the no acupuncture control group received minor interventions not  provided in the other two groups [67-70]. finally, for one study presenting an asymmetric  confidence interval for the continuous main outcome measure we were unable to  unambiguously calculate the standard deviation [71]. the latter five trials were included in a  sensitivity analysis as “borderline” studies.    description of included studies  the 37 eligible trials included a total of 5754 patients (median 75, minimum 30, maximum  638). fourteen trials (3369 patients) addressed chronic pain or a condition associated with  chronic pain (table 1); eight were short-term trials with duration of less than three days (522  patients; table 2) investigating whether acupuncture is helpful for sedation, anxiety, pain or  nausea associated with surgical operations, endoscopic interventions or labour; and 15 trials  (1863 patients) addressed a variety of other conditions (table 3). ten of the 14 chronic pain  trials, but only six of the remaining 23 studies, reported an adequate method of allocation  concealment. drop-out rates were between 54% and 95% in three addiction trials but low in  most other studies. ten chronic pain trials and three trials on other conditions both reported 


 11 an adequate method of allocation concealment and a drop-out rate below 15%, and were  classified as having a lower risk of bias.  fifteen studies had a clearly predefined main outcome measure. for 32 trials a continuous  effect size measure could be calculated, for 24 trials a dichotomous (for 19 trials both).  acupuncture interventions varied strongly regarding number of sessions, type of acupuncture  (classical acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, ear acupuncture), level of individualisation for  point selection, and number of needles used. in 31 trials the sham procedure involved skin  penetration (in seven trials at acupuncture points not indicated for the condition treated and  in 24 trials outside known acupuncture points); six trials used approaches without skin  penetration (in three trials at the same points as in the acupuncture group and in three trials  outside known points).    meta-analysis of non-specific effects (sham acupuncture vs. no acupuncture)  the main analyses are based on the 32 trials reporting data on a continuous outcome. for  the comparison of sham acupuncture with no acupuncture, the pooled standardized mean  differences (smd) were -0.53 (95%ci -0.67, -0.39) among chronic pain trials, -0.23 (-0.50,  0.04) among short-term studies and -0.42 (95%ci -0.66, -0.18) in other studies (figure 2).  the test for differences between diagnostic subgroups missed statistical significance at the  5% level (p = 0.08). effect sizes showed moderate statistical heterogeneity among chronic  pain studies, no heterogeneity among short term studies and marked heterogeneity among  the other studies. if studies were pooled across clinical subgroups the smd was -0.45  (95%ci -0.57, -0.34). in seven trials effects over no treatment groups were large (smds were  above -0.7), in nine trials moderate (between -0.4 and -0.7), and in 16 small (< -0.4). results  were similar when borderline studies were included, when in studies without a predefined  main outcome measure other outcomes were chosen or when dichotomous outcomes were  analyzed (see web appendix table 3). egger’s test did not suggest funnel plot asymmetry (p  = 0.25; asymmetry coefficient 0.21, figure 3). in exploratory subgroup analyses (see web  appendix table 3) effect sizes differed significantly according to the level of co-intervention 


 12 (larger if less co-interventions) and according to the type of sham intervention (larger if no  skin penetration). non-specific effects tended to be larger in trials with larger sample size,  lower risk of bias, and a clearly predefined outcome, but the differences were not statistically  significant. in multivariate meta-regression analyses only the association with level of co- interventions approached statistical significance (p = 0.07). trials with larger effects of sham  over no acupuncture reported smaller effects of acupuncture over sham intervention than  trials with smaller non-specific effects (β = -0.39, p = 0.029).     meta-analysis of specific effects (acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture) and total effects  (acupuncture vs. no acupuncture)  for the comparison of acupuncture with sham acupuncture, the pooled random effects smds  were -0.46 (95%ci -0.72, -0.20) for chronic pain studies, -0.34 (95%ci -0.79, 0.12) for short  term studies, and -0.28 (-0.59, 0.03) for other studies (see web appendix figure 1). there  were no statistically significant (p = 0.71) differences between diagnostic subgroups, but  there was substantial statistical heterogeneity in all three clinical categories. if trials were  pooled across categories the smd was -0.37 (95%ci -0.55, -0.19). the funnel plot was  highly asymmetrical (web appendix figure 2; p = 0.002; asymmetry coefficient -0.52). larger  trials yielded significantly less positive results than smaller trials (smds -0.15 (95%ci -0.31,  0.01) vs. -0.59 (95%ci -0.93, -0.24), p < 0.001). specific effects were also smaller in trials  with lower risk of bias and more intense co-interventions, while skin penetration and  condition did not have a significant influence.   the pooled smds between acupuncture and no acupuncture were -0.94 (95%ci -1.20, - 0.67) for chronic pain studies, -0.60 (95%ci -1.08, -0.12) for short term studies, and -0.63 (- 0.91, -0.35) for other studies (see web appendix figure 3) with marked heterogeneity in all  three categories. if all studies were pooled the smd was -0.77 (95%ci -0.94, -0.59). there  was significant (p = 0.03; asymmetry coefficient -0.38) funnel plot asymmetry with smaller  studies yielding larger effect estimates (see web appendix figure 4 for the funnel plot).   


 13 discussion  summary of main findings  according to our findings (sham) acupuncture interventions are often associated with  noteworthy non-specific effects. differences between sham acupuncture and no acupuncture  groups tended to be smaller in trials in which there were intense co-interventions in all study  groups. indicators of study quality (sample size, risk of bias, predefinition of a main outcome  measure) were not associated significantly with effect size. trials with larger effects of sham  over no acupuncture reported smaller effects of acupuncture over sham intervention than  trials with smaller non-specific effects. in our analyses we also found small to moderate  specific effects of acupuncture interventions over sham acupuncture, however, trials with  large sample size and low risk of bias yielded less positive results. in our study set the total  effect of acupuncture interventions including both specific and non-specific effects was, on  average, at least moderate in size.     strengths and limitations  although we did not systematically search chinese language databases our review is  currently the most comprehensive and largest analysis of randomized trials of acupuncture  including both a sham and a no treatment control group. it includes many more and larger  trials than previous analyses [21-23]. the overall findings are highly robust to sensitivity  analyses and indicators of study quality. the most important limitation of our review is the  strong heterogeneity of our trial set regarding patients, interventions, outcomes and  methodological quality. we do not think that pooling such a heterogeneous set of studies  would be adequate if the aim was primarily to assess effectiveness for clinical decision- making. however, our primary aim was to investigate whether (sham) acupuncture  interventions are, on average, associated with relevant non-specific effects. to assess the  size of non-specific effects it is necessary to include trials with both a sham and a no  acupuncture control group. as the number of such trials is limited pooling all available 


 14 information can be justified for generating hypotheses and has been performed in the  cochrane review on placebo effects in all conditions in a much more radical manner [21].   the comparisons between sham acupuncture and acupuncture in the primary studies  included in our review are unblinded. as almost all trials focussed on patient-reported  outcome measures there is considerable risk of bias. patients randomized to the no  treatment group might be disappointed and experience “nocebo” effects, or might give overly  negative ratings for subjective symptoms. on the other hand, patients randomized to no  treatment groups might use larger doses of rescue medication or co-interventions which  would lead to an underestimation of the differences. in fact, in some of the trials included in  our review patients in no acupuncture control groups had higher analgesic use than patients  in the sham groups (e.g. [51, 53]). insufficient blinding is also a problem for the comparison  between acupuncture and placebo acupuncture [23]. however, if patients find out that they  are in a sham group one would expect rather an underestimation of the effect of sham over  no treatment. in summary, it is difficult to assess to what extent and in which direction biases  can distort effect estimates between sham and no acupuncture groups. it is noteworthy that  although indicators of study quality were not significantly associated with the size of non- specific effects, better and larger studies tended to report larger effects. it seems that our  estimate of non-specific effects is less subject to small study bias and other biases than  those for specific and total effects.    interpretation  our findings are highly consistent with smaller analyses available in the literature [22-23].  the re-analysis of the 21 acupuncture trials included in the cochrane review on placebo  effects yielded a smd of -0.41 [22]. due to slightly different inclusion criteria five trials were  excluded for the current analyses. a meta-analysis by madsen et al. [23] who reviewed 13  three-armed trials on acupuncture for acute and chronic pain found a smd of -0.42. nine of  the studies included in their review were also included by us while we excluded four trials 


 15 due to slightly different selection criteria. our main analysis includes 23 additional trials  (including seven trials addressing chronic or acute pain).   it has been argued that sham interventions in which needles penetrate the skin (particularly if  applied in the same dermatomes as the true acupuncture intervention) are physiologically not  inert and, therefore, should not be considered as placebos [5]. our exploratory subgroup  analyses (as well as similar analyses in the review by madsen et al. [23]) do not provide  evidence that sham interventions involving needle penetration are associated with larger  non-specific than those which do not. thus, the limited available data suggests that skin  penetration or no skin penetration does not seem to make a big difference.  if acupuncture should have indeed relevant total effects but only very limited specific effects  this would have major implications for the conduct and interpretation of clinical trials. based  on our data and available systematic reviews [2-5, 72] it seems reasonable to assume an  average smd of 0.4 (or more) for non-specific effects and of 0.2 smd (or less) for specific  effects at least for a number of conditions. to achieve 80% power a two-armed sham- controlled clinical trial investigating a specific effect of 0.2 smd would have to recruit about  800 patients. this suggests that almost all available trials comparing true and sham  acupuncture would be underpowered.   one could argue that a smd of 0.2 is clinically irrelevant. in line with that reasoning madsen  et al. questioned in their review “the prevailing hypothesis that acupuncture has an important  effect on pain in general” [23]. however, we believe that another conclusion is possible, too.  as ourselves, madsen et al. have found, on average, a moderately large effect of sham  interventions over no acupuncture groups, and both reviews found at least small specific  effects of acupuncture over sham interventions. the total effect of acupuncture seems to be  at least moderate in size in a number of conditions, and such effects can well be clinically  relevant. for many established drug treatments smds over placebo are in the range  between 0.3 and 0.5 (e.g. [75-76]). if, as the available data suggests [21] clinical effects  associated with pharmacological placebos are small compared to no treatment (with a smd  of 0.1 on average) the total effects of these treatments could be in a similar range (around a 


 16 smd of 0.4 to 0.6) as those of several acupuncture interventions. it could be argued that for  a suffering individual it does not matter whether relief is due to specific or non-specific  effects. however, as the evidence for larger non-specific effects of acupuncture compared to  other treatments comes with one exception [18] from indirect comparisons open to  confounding firm conclusions are not yet possible.  we think that our findings are of major relevance to the question of how the clinical  effectiveness of complex non-drug interventions should be assessed. it is likely that non- specific effects vary between different types of complex treatment interventions. the concept  of specific and non-specific effects might not be fully adequate in that case, as so-called non- specific effects might turn out to be characteristic for a given therapeutic setting. if the total  effect of an intervention in clinical practice would indeed consist of variable contributions of  specific and non-specific effects it could be that a treatment which has only minor or even no  specific but clinically relevant non-specific effects has a larger total effect than a treatment  with moderate specific but only minor non-specific effects. this has been denoted the  efficacy paradox [72]. should such a treatment be readily available? the position of a  pragmatic decision-maker could be yes if the comparator treatment represents adequate  standard treatment. in fact, in germany acupuncture is routinely reimbursed for chronic low  back pain as in a large randomized trial acupuncture (but also sham acupuncture which is  not reimbursed) was more effective than treatment based on german guidelines [73].  sceptical scientists would argue that these results are likely to be biased due to lack of  blinding and that acupuncture should not be considered effective. furthermore, if issues such  as expectancies, beliefs and trust should have a relevant influence on the effectiveness of a  treatment, findings of clinical trials might no longer be valid when attitudes in a population  change over time.     conclusions  sham acupuncture interventions are often associated with moderately large non-specific  effects which could make it difficult to detect small additional specific effects. compared to 


 17 inert placebo interventions effects associated with sham acupuncture might be larger which  would have considerable implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. total  effects of acupuncture interventions including both specific and non-specific effects often  seem to be at least moderate in size. we believe that there has to be a discussion involving  scientists, decision-makers, health care providers and patients whether and when the  evidence for clinically relevant total effects from non-blinded comparisons is sufficient to  consider a treatment effective even if specific effects due to the postulated mechanism of  action might be minor or even non-existing.       competing interests  klaus linde has received travel reimbursement and fees for speaking at conferences  organized by acupuncture societies in the usa, uk, germany, japan and spain. antonius  schneider has received fees for lecturing for a german acupuncture society (dägfa) until  2006. karin meissner and karin niemann do not have any conflicts of interest.    authors’ contributions  kl, kn and km were involved in the literature search, data extraction and analysis. as  provided advice on acupuncture and participated in the interpretation of the data. kl  conceived and coordinated the study and wrote the first draft of the manuscript. all authors  commented on drafts and approved the final manuscript.    acknowledgements  funding for this project was neither applied for nor received.   the authors would like to thank asbjørn hrobjartsson, levente kriston, mike cummings and  benno brinkhaus for critically commenting on earlier versions of the manuscript. part of this
