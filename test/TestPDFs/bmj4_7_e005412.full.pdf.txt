it is thought that there may be critical periods at spe- ciﬁc time points early in life when accelerated growth predisposes to hypertension later in life.7–10 furthermore, rapid increase in weight for length in the ﬁrst 6 months has been associated with higher systolic blood pressure in 3-year-olds.11 few studies have assessed indicators of body fat distribution in infants and young children. body fat distribution has been associated with risk factor scores for cardiovascular risk in young chil- dren12 and postnatal rapid weight gain has been linked to deposition of fat centrally in children at 5 years.6 therefore, insight into whether postnatal alterations in body composition inﬂuence blood pressure in early childhood is relevant to the development of preventative strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life. our aim was to assess how gains in adiposity, fat distribution and body size between birth, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months relate to the blood pressure of children at 36 months. methods study sample: the southampton women’s survey (sws) the sws is a large prospective cohort study which started in 1998.13 a total of 12 583 non-pregnant women aged 20–34 years were recruited to the study. detailed information on diet and sociodemographic factors was collected and children born to sws women were assessed at birth and then followed up at home by trained research nurses. the research conformed to the principles embodied in the declaration of helsinki. there were 1981 singleton live births to women in the sws by the end of 2003. after exclusion of infants with major congenital abnormalities (n=2) and neonatal deaths (n=6), 1973 sws infants remained for postnatal follow-up. maternal and child data when each child was 24-months-old, the occupations of its mother and her partner were recorded and the highest ranking of these used to deﬁne the child’s social class. the social class scale was: professional (i), management and technical (ii), skilled non-manual (iiin), skilled manual (iiim), partly skilled (iv) and unskilled (v). for 10 children whose parental occupa- tions were missing at this time, employment status recorded during early pregnancy was used. educational attainment of the mother recorded before pregnancy was deﬁned in six groups, from ‘none’ to ‘degree or above’. body composition and blood pressure assessment anthropometric measurements were taken by trained researchers at birth, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. apart from those at birth, all measurements were taken in the children’s homes. infant crown-heel length was mea- sured with a neonatometer (cms ltd, london, uk). child height was measured with a portable stadiometer (leicester height measurer; cms ltd). skinfold thicknesses were measured using holtain skinfold calli- pers (holtain ltd) at speciﬁed sites and abdominal cir- cumference was taken at the end of expiration using a blank tape measured against a ﬁxed scale. strict moni- toring of the nurses’ measurement techniques was per- formed by the senior research nurse and regular inter-observer variation studies were conducted. blood pressure was measured using a critikon dinamap 1846 sx automated blood pressure device14 with the child seated. three measurements were recorded and the average of the last two used in the ana- lysis. owing to limited equipment availability, blood pres- sure measurements were only available for approximately 47% of the sws children. statistical analysis regression coefﬁcients (β), with associated 95% cis, were used to assess the strength of association between body size indicators (body weight, length/height, abdominal circumference and subscapular skinfold thickness). z-scores were calculated for body weight and length/height using the 1990 british growth references for time points 6, 12, 24 and 36 months.15 z-scores for abdominal circumference and subscapular skinfolds were calculated internally using the sws sample and were adjusted for gender, current age and gestational age. conditional growth was derived from the residuals resulting from regression of the z-score for the measure- ment at a speciﬁc time point on the z-scores for mea- surements at all preceding ages. for example, the dependent variable ‘conditional gain in body weight from 12 to 24 months’ was derived as the residual of the regression of body weight z-score at 24 months on the z-scores for body weight at 12 months, 6 months and birth. factors reported to be associated with blood pressure were assessed using linear regression, including age, social class, maternal education attainment, smoking in late pregnancy (an indicator of smoking throughout pregnancy) and crying of the child during blood pres- sure measurement. factors that were univariately asso- ciated with blood pressure at age 36 months were retained for inclusion in regression models, namely crying, smoking and education. multiple regression analysis was performed by entering all independent variables of interest into the model, in addition to the confounding variables. a stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify the growth variables that were most strongly associated with blood pressure at 36 months. statistical analyses were performed using spss pasw statistics release v.18 (ibm spss, ibm corp, new york), and stata v.12.0 (statacorp, texas, usa). results at 36 months of age, 1640 children (83% of the 1973 available for follow-up) were followed-up. birth weights and blood pressure measurements at age 36 months were 2 nowson ca, crozier sr, robinson sm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005412. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005412 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


available for 773 infants. seven children with missing height and weight data at age 36 months and ﬁve with sys- tolic pressures more than three sds from the mean were excluded, leaving 761 in the analysis. children in this study were similar to the larger population sample of sws children seen at 36 months (table 1). owing to a relative unavailability of blood pressure machines during later ﬁeldwork, children included in the analyses were more likely to have been visited earlier in the study, and their mothers were slightly younger. additionally, com- pared with those not included, those children in the study were marginally older (by approximately 1 week), and lighter and shorter at birth, and their mothers were of lower social class, had lower educational qualiﬁcations and were more likely to have been smoking in late preg- nancy. the full ranges of social classes and educational levels were represented in the analysis sample, although the ‘professional/management and technical’ social class accounted for around 40% of the population, and just over half the mothers had completed higher school/post- school qualiﬁcations. the greatest relative and absolute increases in body weight, height/length, abdominal circumference and subscapular skinfold thickness occurred between birth and 6 months (table 2), with the other age intervals (6–12, 12–24 and 24–36 months) indicating smaller positive increments for body weight and height. mean values of height and weight were comparable to the 50th centile.15 for subscapular skinfold, average changes between later ages from 6 m were negative, as was the average change in abdominal circumference between 24 and 36 months. during this ﬁnal age period, abdominal circumference increased in 39% of children but decreased in 60%. confounding variables age, gender and social class were not associated with blood pressure, but the 45 infants who cried during measurement had higher systolic (p=0.004) and diastolic pressures (p=0.001). smoking in late pregnancy was associated with higher systolic (p=0.067) and diastolic pressures (p=0.005). lower educational attainment (p=0.024) was associated with higher diastolic pressure. associations with blood pressure at 36 months initially, the four anthropometric measurements were considered separately (table 3). each model contained the measurement at birth and the conditional changes in the measure over the four age periods (0–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–36 months), along with the confounding factors that contributed signiﬁcantly to the regression analysis; the slope represents the change in blood pres- sure (mm hg) per sd change in growth measurement. table 1 maternal and infant characteristics of the southampton women’s survey study group with bp measurement (n=761) without bp measurement (n=879) mean sd mean sd mothers maternal age at birth of the child*** 29.7 3.7 30.6 3.8 pre-pregnancy weight (kg) 67.3 13.9 68.3 13.9 height (cm) 163.0 6.5 163.4 6.3 maternal bmi (pre-pregnancy; kg/m2) 25.3 4.8 25.5 4.8 per cent per cent smoking in pregnancy* 16.2 12.2 social class professional/management and technical (i/ii) 39.2 43.0 skilled manual/non-manual (iii) 48.4 46.5 partly skilled/unskilled (iv/v) 12.4 10.6 educational attainment* compulsory education to age 16 years 44.9 39.0 postcompulsory education 55.1 61.0 infants gender—male, n (%) 397 (52.2) 473 (53.8) age in years at 36 months visit*** 3.09 0.10 3.07 0.09 weight (kg) at 36 months visit 15.0 1.9 15.1 1.8 height (cm) at 36 months visit 95.7 3.7 96.0 3.6 abdominal circumference (cm) at 36 months visit 51.2 3.2 51.3 3.1 subscapular skinfold (mm) at 36 months visit 6.63 1.85 6.49 1.76 systolic bp (mm hg) at 36 months visit 93.8 8.3 diastolic bp (mm hg) at 36 months visit 58.1 6.3 birth weight (kg)** 3.42 0.57 3.50 0.52 birth length (cm)* 49.8 2.1 50.0 2.0 *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. bmi, body mass index; bp, blood pressure. nowson ca, crozier sr, robinson sm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005412. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005412 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


in all four models, the measurements at birth were not associated with blood pressure, and independent of measurements of postnatal growth. the model for abdominal circumference explained more of the vari- ance in blood pressure (8.8% and 7.7%, respectively, for systolic and diastolic blood pressure; ﬁgure 1) than the models for the other three measures, with the model for weight coming a close second (6.7% and 5.5% of the variance explained for systolic and diastolic blood pres- sure). the change in abdominal circumference closest to the blood pressure measurement, 24–36 months, was related most strongly to blood pressure (systolic and dia- stolic), but change during the ﬁrst 6 months of life was also signiﬁcantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. weight change between birth and 6 months was related to blood pressure at 36 months, but weight change between 12 and 24 months also appeared to inﬂuence systolic and diastolic blood pres- sure. neither height nor subscapular skinfold thickness changes were related to blood pressure as strongly as abdominal circumference or weight changes, although for diastolic blood pressure there was a robust associ- ation with height change between 12 and 24 months. the effect sizes for the signiﬁcant associations of body fat distribution and body weight were such that a one sd score increase in the measurement between the two ages under consideration was associated with an increase of around 1–2 mm hg in systolic blood pressure and approximately 1 mm hg in diastolic pressure. the results of the ﬁnal regression models are pre- sented in table 4. in the combined model, abdominal cir- cumference (0–6 and 24–36 months) and weight change (12–24 months) remained signiﬁcantly associated with systolic blood pressure. the growth variables contributing to the ﬁnal models were not highly correlated, with all correlations being less than 0.15. there was considerable variability in the gains of abdominal mass between 24 and 36 months, where 39% of children experienced an increase in abdominal circumference. abdominal cir- cumference change in the age period leading up to the blood pressure measurement was the key inﬂuence on blood pressure, with a one sd score change in the cir- cumference being associated with a 1.66 mm hg increase in systolic blood pressure. the ﬁnal model for diastolic blood pressure was similar, with key associations being abdominal circumference change in the earliest and latest age periods (0–6 and 24–36 months) with a one sd increase in abdominal circumference change associated with approximately 1 mm hg higher diastolic blood pres- sure. after the abdominal circumference changes were included in the model, changes in weight no longer appeared to inﬂuence blood pressure, but height change table 2 body composition at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and incremental changes absolute change % change* mean sd mean sd mean sd n=712 birth weight (kg) 3.4 0.6 δwt (kg): 0–36 months 11.6 1.8 349.7 92.7 weight (kg) 6 months 7.9 1.0 δwt (kg): 0–6 months 4.4 0.9 134.4 43.6 weight (kg) 12 months 10.0 1.2 δwt (kg): 6–12 months 2.1 0.6 27.2 8.2 weight (kg) 24 months 12.5 1.5 δwt (kg):12–24 months 2.6 0.9 26.0 8.5 weight (kg) 36 months 15.0 1.9 δwt (kg): 24–36 months 2.5 0.9 20.1 7.0 n=666 birth length (cm) 49.8 2.1 δht (cm): 0–36 months 46 3.2 92.7 8.3 height (cm) 6 months 67.2 2.5 δht (cm): 0–6 months 17.4 2.1 35.1 5.0 height (cm) 12 months 75.6 2.7 δht (cm): 6–12 months 8.4 1.8 12.6 2.8 height (cm) 24 months 86.3 3.1 δht (cm): 12–24 months 10.8 1.9 14.3 2.5 height (cm) 36 months 95.8 3.6 δht (cm): 24–36 months 9.5 1.6 11.0 1.9 n=682 abdominal circum.† (cm) 0 month 31.5 2.2 δcircum.

between 12 and 24 months was retained in the model. the addition of the variables ‘ever breast-fed’ or ‘dur- ation of breast feeding’ to the ﬁnal models did not affect the relationships between blood pressure and body com- position measures. discussion main findings our data indicate that conditional gains in abdominal cir- cumference between birth and 6 months, as well as in the 12 months prior to blood pressure measurement, were associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 36 months of age. changes in weight were also associated with blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure, but to a lesser extent. in the multivariate regression model, a one sd gain in abdominal circumference z-score between 24 and 36 months was associated with a 1.66 mm hg increase in systolic blood and a one sd increase between birth and 6 months with 1.56 mm hg. there was considerable variability in the gains of abdom- inal mass at the time interval most predictive of blood pressure (24–36 months), with 39% of children experiencing an increase, suggesting the impact of environmental factors. it is possible that dietary intake and/or physical activity levels during this early period could alter abdominal circumfer- ence gain early in life, or it may be related to differences in growth trajectories,16 which predict later obesity. given that abdominal circumference in the majority of children decreases between the ages of 24 and 36 months, increases seen in this time period might be an early marker for pro- blems in later life, particularly if the effect of abdominal cir- cumference change on blood pressure ampliﬁes with age. it is of note that subscapular skinfold thickness change, an indicator of subcutaneous fat deposition, had much weaker associations with blood pressure than abdominal circumference, which is an indicator of abdominal or vis- ceral fat deposition. the ﬁnding that abdominal circumfer- ence gain between 0 and 6 months was more strongly associated with blood pressure at age 36 months than gains during 6–12 and 12–24 months could reﬂect the proposed critical period for childhood adiposity in the ﬁrst 2 months of life,17 or could reﬂect gains in adiposity associated with an adverse intrauterine environment in late gestation. figure 1 association between change in abdominal circumference (residuals derived from regressing the z-score at each specific age on the z-score at all preceding ages, adjusted for crying and maternal educational attainment and smoking during pregnancy) as the independent variable and blood pressure at 36 months (mm hg). z-scores are based on data from the southampton women’s survey, adjusted for gender, current age and gestational age. table 4 multivariate regression model of best fit: conditional gain* (z-scores) in body size and fat distribution associations with blood pressure at 36 months† adjusted r2 β 95% ci p value systolic pressure, n=650 0.094 abdominal circumference‡§: 0–6 months 1.52 0.07 1.71 0.04 abdominal circumference‡§: 24–36 months 1.66 0.94 2.27 <0.0001 weight: 12–24 months‡¶ 0.79 0.16 1.39 0.01 diastolic pressure, n=625 0.076 abdominal circumference‡§: 0–6 months 0.95 0.48 1.42 <0.001 abdominal circumference‡§: 24–36 months 0.94 0.46 1.43 <0.001 height: 12–24 months‡¶ 0.60 0.12 1.08 0.015 *residuals derived from regression model with the specified z-score as the independent variable. †all analyses adjusted for crying, maternal education and maternal smoking in late pregnancy. ‡adjusted for all the preceding time intervals (0–6, 6–12, 12–24, 24–36 months). §z-scores based on sample population data from southampton women’s survey. ¶z-scores derived from percentile curve growth charts uk.15 6 nowson ca, crozier sr, robinson sm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005412. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005412 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


strengths and weaknesses as summarised earlier, a strength of this study is the large sample size drawn from the general population. a post hoc power calculation (n=650, with sd of 8 mm hg for systolic pressure) indicated there was 80% power to detect a regression coefﬁcient of 0.88 mm hg per one sd of an independent variable at 5% level of signiﬁ- cance. our study was thus sufﬁciently large to detect effect sizes of clinical relevance. in addition, we have assessed conditional growth, accounting for measure- ments at previous ages (thus ensuring independence of growth summaries between age periods), and have adjusted for relevant confounding factors. few studies have collected such detailed anthropomet- ric measurements with the methodological rigour to provide indicators of fat distribution in the early post- natal period, encompassing the transition from milk only to a mixed diet at the age of 36 months. it is clear from the data that the strongest association with blood pressure from all the anthropometric mea- surements is the gain in abdominal circumference; however, we acknowledge that when building a multivari- ate regression model of best ﬁt, there is an element of chance as to which variables are included, even when they are not highly correlated. a limitation of the study is the inability to measure blood pressure in all children in the cohort, although there do not appear to be noteworthy differences between those who were measured and the remainder. comparison with other studies central adiposity and a large waist circumference have been associated with higher blood pressure in adults, but there are few reports for children. in one study, chil- dren with accelerated weight gain in the ﬁrst 2 years of life were fatter and had more central fat distribution at 5 years of age than other children.6 however, the rela- tionship of central fat deposition speciﬁcally to blood pressure, which is only one component of the metabolic syndrome, is not clear in children. rapid weight gain during infancy (0–6 months) but not during early child- hood (3–6 years) was associated with a higher metabolic risk score at age 17 years, but the association between waist circumference and blood pressure was not statistic- ally signiﬁcant in that study.18 waist-for-height ratio in school children has not been found to confer additional discriminative power to bmi in some studies,19 20 but recently weight and weight-for-height changes through infancy and childhood have been associated with blood pressure at age 1021 and at age 9.1 and 15.5 years.22 these studies did not consider the periods 0–6 and 6– 12 months separately, nor examine change in abdominal circumference. however, similar to both reports, we found that weight changes at ages closest to those at which the blood pressure measurement was carried out were most strongly associated. there is considerable debate as to whether there are speciﬁc age periods early in life during which weight gain and/or fat deposition are more inﬂuential in predicting cardiovascular risk. our ﬁndings are similar to a report that weight gain between 24 and 36 months was positively associated with systolic blood pressure.23 the mean blood pressure values in our study of 94/58 mm hg are similar to those reported (92/58 mm hg),23 as are the correla- tions between systolic blood pressure and current weight and height at 36 months. similarly, we also did not ﬁnd an inverse association between birth weight and blood pressure. however, in contrast we found that conditional gains in body weight between all age periods were posi- tively associated with systolic blood pressure and a similar trend for diastolic pressure, except for the period between 6 and12 months. the differences in results may be related to our adjustment for all previous time inter- vals when we determined conditional growth. our data support a developmental contribution to the origin of elevated blood pressure in childhood, and therefore potentially in later adulthood. indeed, we have previously demonstrated that higher fetal liver blood ﬂow is strongly correlated with greater fat mass at birth and at 4 years, indicating that inﬂuences on body composition operate very early in life.24 our data show that changes in abdominal circumference during the ﬁrst 6 months and in the third year of life are associated with systolic and dia- stolic blood pressure. this suggests that the tracking of blood pressure, evident by later childhood, might be a consequence of under supply of conditionally essential nutrients associated with elevated fetal liver blood ﬂow and prioritisation of fat deposition in the infant. it is not clear whether postnatal interventions would be effective in limiting growth in abdominal circumfer- ence, and any interventions to limit abdominal circum- ference gains would likely also reduce the rate of growth. however, there is accumulating evidence that accelerated early growth has long-term adverse physio- logical effects in later life, increasing cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure.25 26 promotion of lifestyle practices, such as exclusive breast feeding up to 6 months, later introduction of solid foods and maxi- mising opportunities for safe physical activity, could con- tribute to a reduction in accelerated growth early in life and be one pathway that results in a reduction in cardio- vascular disease later in life. conclusion we have demonstrated that although conditional gains in body weight and height during speciﬁc age periods are associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as previously recognised, conditional gains in abdominal circumference (associated with central fat deposition) have the strongest association with blood pressure at 36 months of age. this is especially true for the ﬁrst 6 months of life and between 24 and 36 months (ie, the year prior to blood pressure measurement). therefore, central deposition of fat in early childhood, indicated by abdominal circumference, may contribute to an nowson ca, crozier sr, robinson sm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005412.
