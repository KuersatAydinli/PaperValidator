hygiene. infections due to lack of hygiene during men- struation have been reported in many studies.10–15 they also revealed that most adolescent girls had incomplete and inaccurate information about menstrual physiology and hygiene. the menstrual information they did have was acquired primarily through mothers, television, friends, teachers and relatives.5 16 17 menstruation is still regarded as unclean or dirty in bangladeshi society.4 because of various myths, miscon- ceptions and restrictions practiced during menstruation, adolescent girls in bangladesh often develop negative attitudes towards this natural physiological phenomenon. the majority of girls lack scientiﬁc knowledge about menstruation and puberty.18 adolescent girls in bangladesh are often reluctant to discuss this topic with their parents and hesitant to seek help regarding their menstrual problems. most girls are not informed about menarche or how to manage menstrual bleeding.18 studies in rural bangladesh and india found that 69.0% of adolescent girls were using old pieces of cloth or even no protection at all during menstruation.19 20 therefore, the need to create awareness and increase access to sani- tary facilities essential for menstrual hygiene is import- ant for school-aged adolescents in bangladesh. learning about menstrual hygiene is a vital part of health education for adolescent girls so that they can continue to work and maintain hygenic habits through- out their adult life.21 the ideal menstrual health educa- tion curriculum would encourage students to think about the relationships between knowledge, choice, behaviours and enhanced human health. it would also help to improve maternal health, which can have an impact on the millennium development goals (mdgs), for example mdg5.22 however, despite the need to achieve mdgs, to our knowledge no study has been con- ducted on an educational intervention on menstrual hygiene among school girls in bangladesh. therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effective- ness of a school-based menstrual education programme regarding: (1) menstrual knowledge, beliefs and prac- tices, (2) menstrual disorders experienced, and (3) the restrictions practiced by 6–8 grade school girls in bangladesh. methods study design and participants this intervention study was conducted in araihazar thana in the narayanganj district in bangladesh. araihazar thana is 25 km south-east of the capital, dhaka. it has a total area of 183.35 km2, 63 080 house- hold units and a population of 331 556. males constitute 51.7% of the population, and females 48.3%. araihazar has an average literacy rate of 53.0% (7+ years of formal education), compared to the national average of 68.4%.23 of 26 high schools (grade 6–10) in the study area, 2 were full government schools and 24 were semi- government schools. we selected one of the government schools and two of the 24 semi-government schools using a simple random sampling method (we drew numbers). we only selected three schools due to limited time and resources. these schools were well-established, older schools and conveniently located. one was a girls-only school and the other two were co-educational. the socio-economic, cultural, religious and geographical characteristics of the schools were very similar. the schools were more than 2 km apart. a total of 597 ado- lescent girl attended the three schools, 438 of whom were willing to join the study. participants were selected using the following criteria: (1) they were in grades 6–8, (2) were not critically ill, and (3) had achieved menar- che. as 22 girls had not yet reached menarche, 416 par- ticipants were recruited (ﬁgure 1). participants were between 11 and 16 years of age and were living with their parents. data collection procedures before conducting each interview, the principal investi- gator (seh) visited all three schools and received per- mission to conduct the survey and to provide health education to the adolescent girls attending the school. after permission was received, we conducted a pilot survey of the questionnaire and revised it, as suggested, for the ﬁnal survey. in accordance with the general guidelines required for a full study, we selected 10% of the sample (n=42) for a pilot test in one of the schools in the study area.24 the questionnaire was drafted in english and then translated into bangla, the national language of bangladesh. back-translation from bangla to english was carried out as a validation exercise before and after the pre-test questionnaire was administered. we also modiﬁed the questionnaire based on the results of the pre-test exercise to make it easier to understand and to answer. the baseline survey was conducted in april 2012. trained research assistants (ras) read the questions out loud and the participants answered. a group of 12–15 students participated in each exercise led by one ra, and we requested them not to discuss the survey questions with their peers. after each session, we invited another group to participate in the survey. the room was provided by the school. after completion of the baseline survey, we hired a supervisor, a local obstetrician/gynaecologist, and three ras with good knowledge of the study’s target popula- tion. before the survey, we gave 4 days of training to the ras and one female teacher (selected from the partici- pating schools) on adolescent health education, focus- ing on menstrual hygiene and the importance of maintaining the conﬁdentiality of the participants’ infor- mation. the training was delivered using a ﬁeld manual which we had developed in the bangla language. menstrual education focused on menstrual hygiene knowledge, beliefs and behaviours, menstrual disorders, and restrictions on menstruating adolescents. the edu- cational materials were developed by an obstetrician/ 2 haque se, rahman m, itsuko k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004607. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004607

gynaecologist and were culturally acceptable to the girls. they received menstrual health education from the female ras and in the same classroom where they were regularly taught. males were not allowed entry to the room during health education. twelve 45-min lessons were delivered by the ras once every 15 days. the ras also used clean cloths and pads for demonstration pur- poses, and showed the girls how to dry and store them. female ras were recruited for the study, so that adoles- cent girls would feel comfortable discussing these issues. furthermore, 12 focus group discussions (fgds) were conducted in the schools so that ras and adolescent girls could become well acquainted with each other, as menstruation is a very sensitive topic in bangladesh. in addition, fgds were conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention using a qualitative approach. after 6 months of intervention, follow-up data were collected in the schools using the same question- naire as at baseline regarding menstrual hygiene knowl- edge, beliefs and practices, types of complications, and restrictions on menstruating adolescents. ras visited the homes of any students who were not available at school during the follow-up data collection. in students’ homes, ras provided the questionnaire to the students and spoke with them in a private room in keeping with the data collection method in the schools. in addition to collecting other socio-economic data, we also asked the participants about the number of persons per sleeping room in their home; the type of ﬂoor in the house; the type of roof; the type of wall; the type of cooking fuel; the presence of household assets including an electricity supply, radio, tv, mobile phone, refrigerator, watch, bicycle, motorcycle, and source of drinking water; and type of sanitary facility. this study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the bangladesh medical research council (bmrc). prior to the baseline survey, partici- pants were informed about the study, invited to partici- pate, and told of their right to decline. written consent was obtained from parents and verbal consent was obtained from the head teacher, class teacher and participants. in addition, we obtained written permission for this study from the local education ofﬁcer under the ministry of education (moe) in bangladesh. measures intervention components knowledge and beliefs about menstruation this section of the questionnaire consisted of 10 mul- tiple choice questions to determine pupils’ knowledge regarding: (1) normal monthly duration of menstru- ation, (2) poor menstrual hygiene predisposing to infec- tion, (3) hygienic practices preventing menstrual pain, (4) menstrual blood being considered impure, (5) proper sanitary products, (6) cause of menstruation, (7) origin of menstrual blood, (8) age of normal cessation of menstruation, (9) hot or cold food affecting the men- strual cycle, and (10) menstruation as indicating fertility (fecundity). the students’ knowledge and beliefs were scored using a system adopted from previous studies.25–27 each correct response was awarded 1 point, while incorrect or ‘don’t know’ answers received no marks. this gave a total possible score of 10 points. respondents who scored 0–3 points were adjudged to have poor knowl- edge, those with 4–7 points to have medium knowledge, and those with 8–10 points to have high knowledge. cronbach’s α was 0.73 for the knowledge and beliefs instrument. practices related to menstrual hygiene this section of the questionnaire consisted of seven items assessing girls’ menstrual hygiene practices: (1) the absorbent used during menstruation, (2) frequency of changing the absorbent each day, (3) drying of the used absorbent, (4) storing of washed clothes, (5) methods of disposal of the used absorbent, (6) cleaning of external genitalia, and (7) material used for cleaning of external genitalia. a score of 2 was given for good hygienic practices, a score of 1 was given for fair prac- tices, and a score of 0 was given for poor practices. the maximum score was 14 points. students who scored 0–4 figure 1 selection of the sample. haque se, rahman m, itsuko k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004607. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004607 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


points, 5–8 points and 9+ points were judged to have poor, fair and good practices, respectively. cronbach’s α was 0.82 for the practice instrument. menstrual disorders experienced and restrictions during menstruation regarding menstrual disorders experienced by the adoles- cent, the following items were evaluated: (1) regularity of menstrual cycle, (2) types of complications experienced during menstruation, and (3) consultation with someone for menstrual-related complications. this section also contained items to assess girls’ restrictions during menstru- ation: (1) visits to holy places, (2) visits to relatives, friends and neighbours, (3) participation in household activities, and (4) school attendance during menses. dysmenorrhoea was considered as pain in the abdominal, groin or lumbar regions on the day before or on the ﬁrst day of menstruation.28 we also assessed adolescent depres- sion using the children’s depression inventory (cdi).29 the cdi evaluates feelings and ideas grouped into 27 items. scores range from 0 to 54. cronbach’s α was 0 .73 for this section. we considered a cut-off score on the cdi of ≥20 to indicate depressed mood.30 31 stress was measured using the validated perceived stress scale-10 (pss).32 33 pss scores range from 0 to 40, with a high score representing high social stress. cronbach’s α was 0.75. a score ≥20 was considered to indicate high stress.31 statistical analysis data were cross-checked for consistency before ﬁnal data entry using microsoft excel. one person entered the data and then cross-checked it with the principal investi- gator of the study. descriptive analyses were conducted to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. the household wealth index was used as a proxy indicator for household wealth status. the wealth index was constructed from existing data on a household’s ownership of 15 assets and house construc- tion materials as reported by the participants. each asset was assigned a weight (factor score) generated through principle components analysis, and the resulting asset scores were standardised to a standard normal distribu- tion with a mean of 0 and an sd of 1. each household was then assigned a score for each asset, and the scores were summed by household. the sample was then divided into population tertiles: poor, middle and rich. we used mcnemar’s c2 analyses as the same individuals are measured twice (before and after the survey) to evaluate the impact of an education programme on four recurrent themes of menstruation between baseline and follow-up: (1) knowledge and beliefs, (2) menstrual dis- orders experienced, (3) hygiene practices, and (4) men- struation behaviour and restrictions of the school-aged adolescent girls. all analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences (spss) v.18 (spss, chicago, illinois, usa). in all analyses, the level of signiﬁcance was set at p<0.05 (two-tailed). results more than half of the respondents (52.4%) were 11– 13 years old, 13.7% reported that their father had no education, and 11.8% reported that their mother had no education (table 1). approximately 95% were muslim and 41.8% reported there were six or more members in their household. of 416 participants, 27.9% were deﬁned as being poor, 34.6% as being moderately well-off, and 37.5% as being rich. regarding house type, 17.1% reported they lived in a pakka (a house made of bricks), 14.4% in a half-pakka (where only the ﬂoor is made of brick), and 68.5% in a kacha house (no bricks were used to build the house) (table 1). in the pre-test stage, 77.4%, 68.3% and 67.1% of the girls said that they knew how long a normal menstrual cycle lasted (between 21 and 35 days), that poor men- strual hygiene can predispose to infection, and that hygienic practices during menstruation can prevent men- strual pain. at follow-up, adolescents had signiﬁcantly table 1 socio-demographic characteristics of the

increased (p<0.001) their knowledge of these three items (93.5%, 95.7% and 94%). at follow-up, adolescents also mentioned that they now knew that menstrual blood was not impure (67.1% vs 95.9%) and that proper sanitary products should be used for menstrual protection (57.9% vs 81.5%). there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between baseline and follow-up regarding respondents’ knowledge of the cause of menstruation, origin of menstrual blood, or that menstruation indicated fertility. however, during the follow-up period, adoles- cents signiﬁcantly increased their knowledge regarding age at normal cessation of menstruation and the fact that hot and cold foods do not inﬂuence the menstrual cycle. overall, signiﬁcant improvement (p<0.001) was observed regarding adolescents’ self-reported knowledge and beliefs scores at follow-up compared with baseline (51% vs 82.4%; table 2). regarding the absorbent used during menstruation, at baseline over 16% of participants mentioned that they used sanitary pads during menstruation, increasing to over 39% after the education programme. the frequency of changing pads/cloths per day and drying the absorbent outside in sunlight was higher at follow-up compared with baseline. no signiﬁcant differences were observed in the storing of washed clothes between baseline and follow-up. disposal of the absorbent by burial/burning or putting in a dustbin was signiﬁcantly higher at follow-up compared with baseline. the was a signiﬁcant improvement at follow-up compared to baseline in cleaning the genitalia every time the toilet was used or during bathing (table 3). however, no signiﬁcant differences were observed in the material used to clean external genitalia between baseline and follow-up. regarding hygienic practices, more partici- pants stated that they practised good hygiene (88.9% vs 28.8%) at follow-up compared to baseline. at baseline, 94.5% and 78.6% of girls reported that they had regular menstrual cycles and had experienced complications during menstruation. at follow-up, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in the regularity of the menstrual cycle (99.5%; p=0.023) and fewer complica- tions during menstruation (59.6%; p=0.003). as regards physiological symptoms, signiﬁcantly fewer adolescents reported excessive bleeding and greasy skin at follow-up compared with baseline. regarding dysmenorrhoea, sig- niﬁcantly fewer adolescents reported abdominal pain and nausea and/or vomiting at follow-up. regard psy- chological symptoms, there were signiﬁcant differences in the amount of discomfort, stress and depression between baseline and follow-up. at follow-up, respon- dents stated that they were signiﬁcantly more likely to consult someone for menstrual-related complications than at baseline (99.8% vs 90.8%; table 4). in the base- line survey, 45.4% reported that they did not visit rela- tives, friends or neighbours during menstruation and 7.7% reported that they did not attend school during menstruation (table 4). at follow-up, signiﬁcant improve- ments were observed with regard to restrictions followed by the girls. however, there were no signiﬁcant differ- ences regarding restrictions on visits to holy places or doing household activities during menses. discussion to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to evaluate the effect of a school-based educational inter- vention on the menstrual knowledge, beliefs and prac- tices of adolescent girls in bangladesh. the present study demonstrates that knowledge and beliefs regarding menstrual hygiene were low before implementation of the programme. after implementation, there was a sig- niﬁcant increase in knowledge among the adolescents (51% vs 82.4%). this ﬁnding agrees with the results of other studies in saudi arabia and egypt.34 35 table 2 impact of menstrual educational programme on menstruation knowledge and beliefs (n=416) characteristics baseline follow-up percentage change p valuen per cent n per cent duration of normal menstruation cycle 322 77.4 389 93.5 16.1 0.002 poor menstruation hygiene predisposes to infection 284 68.3 398 95.7 27.4 <0.001 good hygiene can prevent menstrual pain 279 67.1 391 94.0 26.9 <0.001 menstruation blood is impure 279 67.1 399 95.9 28.8 <0.001 proper sanitary products should be used for menstruation protection 241 57.9 339 81.5 23.6 <0.001 cause of menstruation 334 80.3 353 84.8 4.5 0.886 origin of menstrual blood 41 9.9 55 13.2 3.3 0.687 age of normal cessation of menstruation 245 58.9 352 84.6 25.7 <0.001 influence of hot or cold food on menses 273 65.6 358 86.1 20.5 0.001 as an indication of fertility (fecundity) 179 43.0 190 45.7 2.7 0.556 knowledge and beliefs grading poor (0–3) 120 28.8 7 1.7 −27.1 <0.001 medium (4–7) 84 20.2 66 15.9 −4.3 high (8–10) 212 51.0 343 82.4 31.4 bold typeface indicates significance level <0.05. haque se, rahman m, itsuko k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004607. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004607 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


hygienic practices during menstruation are very important as poor hygiene affects health by increasing vulnerability to infections of the urinary tract and peri- neum,4 and the reproductive tract.36 in this study, only 22.4% of girls used pads even after the health interven- tion. the remainder used poor quality cloths dyed with toxic pigments, which might make them susceptible to uterine pain. the girls also dry the cloths inside the house, which also might have effects. good hygiene, such as the use of sanitary pads and adequate washing of the genital area, is essential during menstruation.4–6 girls of reproductive age need access to clean and soft absorbent sanitary products, which protects their health in the long run. in the present study, during the pre-intervention phase, only 28.8% of adolescents had good hygiene prac- tices. in the post-intervention phase, there was a signiﬁ- cant improvement in good menstrual practices (60.1%). various studies have shown that health education increases knowledge and positive attitudes towards puberty as a natural physiological phenomenon.37 regarding menstrual disorders among adolescent girls, in the pre-intervention phase, 10.6% and 6.7% of the adolescents reported excessive bleeding and greasy skin, respectively. after implementation of the pro- gramme, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in such disor- ders. dysmenorrhoea is a very common problem among adolescent girls and affects their quality of life. in the pre-intervention phase, 61.5% and 4.6% of adolescents experienced abdominal pain, and nausea and vomit- ing, respectively, which ﬁndings are similar to the results of a study in egypt.35 38 dysmenorrhoea (pain during menses) was reported by most students in this study, with 59.8% reporting severe pain followed by back ache and fatigue, corresponding to the ﬁndings of a study carried out among malaysian school girls in 2009.39 the use of oral contraceptives and hot drinks, respectively, may suppress ovulation and help reduce menstrual ﬂuid prostaglandin activity levels which are responsible for dysmenorrhoea. moreover, regular exercise can induce amenorrhoea and may decrease dysmenorhoea.40 table 3 impact of menstrual educational programme on menstrual hygiene practices by adolescent girls (n=416) characteristics baseline follow-up percentage change p valuen per cent n per cent absorbent used during menstruation 0.003 sanitary pad 70 16.8 163 39.2 22.4 new cloths 207 49.8 209 50.2 0.4 old cloths/other 139 33.4 44 10.6 −22.8 frequency of changing pad/cloths per day <0.001 4+ times 35 8.4 321 77.2 68.8 2–3 times 322 77.4 93 22.4 −55.0 1 time 59 14.2 2 0.5 −13.7 drying of used absorbent <0.001 outside room in sunlight 78 18.8 401 96.4 77.6 inside room with sunlight 46 11.1 5 1.2 −9.9 inside/outside room without sunlight 292 70.1 10 2.4 −67.7 storing of washed cloths 0.077 clean and covered place* 159 38.2 170 40.8 2.6 clean and open space† 104 25.0 85 20.4 −4.6 unclean and open/covered place‡ 153 36.8 129 31.0 −5.8 method of disposal 0.004 buried/burned/dustbin 235 56.5 341 82.0 25.5 latrine 65 15.6 49 11.8 −3.8 throw on road 116 27.9 26 6.2 −21.7 cleaning of genitalia 0.005 every time use toilet 65 15.6 145 34.8 19.2 during bathing 202 48.6 254 61.1 12.5 do not clean 149 35.8 17 4.1 −31.7 material used for cleaning of external genitalia 0.448 water and antiseptic 30 7.2 45 10.8 3.6 soap and water 199 47.8 191 45.9 −1.9 only water/not cleaning 187 45.0 180 43.2 −1.8 practice grading 0.012 poor (0–4) 60 14.4 3 0.7 −13.7 fair (5–8) 236 56.8 43 10.3 −46.5 good (9+) 120 28.8 370 88.9 60.1 *suitcase, box, and cupboard. †store room, anywhere in the room, under a cushion, under the bed, behind the door, in the washroom. ‡gallery, under the kitchen roof, anywhere in the room, under a cushion, under the bed, behind the door, in the washroom. 6 haque se, rahman m, itsuko k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004607. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004607 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


regarding psychological symptoms, discomfort and stress were also signiﬁcantly reduced at follow-up. also at follow-up, the girls were more likely to consult someone about menstrual-related complications than at baseline (99.8% vs 90.8%). this study also demonstrated that respondents reported signiﬁcant improvements in the regularity of their menstrual cycles at follow-up, possibly because they had signiﬁcantly improved their knowledge, beliefs and menstrual hygiene practices. other studies also suggest clear links between poor menstrual hygiene and vaginal scabies, abnormal discharge, and urinary and reproduct- ive tract infections.41 these infections can upset the balance of hormones and cause irregular bleeding.42 in addition, participants’ discomfort and stress also decreased signiﬁcantly after the health intervention. previous studies have shown that when a woman is stressed, her adrenal glands secrete the hormone corti- sol, which may disrupt normal hormone function and cause irregular bleeding.43 during the pre-intervention phase, 45.4% of the girls reported that they did not visit relatives, friends or neighbours during menstruation, and 7.7% reported that they did not attend school during menstruation. signiﬁcant improvements were observed regarding these restrictions at follow-up. however, no signiﬁcant differ- ences were observed regarding restrictions on visits to holy places or doing household activities during men- struation. these ﬁndings demonstrate that socio-cultural beliefs and taboos regarding menstruation are still wide- spread. restrictions on menstruating women were also described in an indian study5 which reported that girls do not perform housework during menstruation. this intervention study has several important ﬁndings and insights for adolescent girls. however, it also has some limitations. first, the ﬁndings in this study were based on self-reported outcomes and may therefore differ from actual behaviour. adolescents may have over- reported their use of good menstrual hygiene in order to satisfy the interviewer. however, all the participants joined the health education session regularly. second, information about complications was obtained from par- ticipants and not from medical records due to time and budget constraints, and so bias may have affected the reliability of the data. however, our ras were trained by physicians to collect such information in a reliable manner. third, although adolescents who experienced pain in the abdominal, groin and lumbar regions on the table 4 impact of menstrual educational programme on menstrual disorders, behaviours and restrictions (n=416) characteristics baseline follow-up percentage change p valuen per cent n per cent menstrual disorders experienced regularity of menstruation 393 94.5 414 99.5 5.0 0.023 complications during menstruation 327 78.6 248 59.6 −19.0 0.002 types of complications during menstruation physiological symptoms excessive bleeding 44 10.6 13 3.1 −7.5 <0.001 headache 32 7.7 28 6.7 −1.0 0.789 increase appetite 26 6.2 18 4.3 −1.9 0.297 greasy skin 28 6.7 6 1.4 −5.3 0.002 dysmenorrhoea pain in abdominal/groin/lumbar region 256 61.5 219 52.6 −8.9 0.012 psychological symptoms 35 8.4 13 3.1 −5.3 0.025 discomfort 22 5.3 3 0.7 −4.6 0.032 high stress* 16 3.8 6 1.4 −2.4 0.052 irritability 18 4.3 3 0.7 −3.6 0.044 depression† consult with someone for menstruation-related complications 378 90.8 415 99.8 9.0 0.003 behaviours and restrictions visit relatives, friends and neighbours during menses 0.002 no 189 45.4 110 26.4 −19.0 yes 227 54.6 306 73.6 19.0 do household activities during menses 0.438 no 94 22.6 85 20.4 −2.2 yes 322 77.4 331 79.6 2.2 attend school during menses 0.019 no 32 7.7 11 2.6 −5.1 yes 384 92.3 405 97.4 5.1 *a cut-off score of ≥20 was considered to indicate high stress. †a cut-off score of ≥20 was considered to indicate depressed mood. haque se, rahman m, itsuko k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004607. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004607 7 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


day before or the ﬁrst day of menstruation, were consid- ered to have dysmenorrhoea in this study, we did not assess the degree of pain using a pain scale. in future, we will certainly consider doing this. also, this study con- cluded that education on menstruation helps to make the menstrual cycle more regular. however, this may have been due to the fact that the girls matured during the study and their cycles naturally became more regular. a study with a control group of girls of a similar age would be helpful to settle this issue. finally, although all possible efforts were made to standardise the educational intervention, it is possible that environmental factors such as differences in the abilities of ras and their ability to disseminate study messages affected the outcome of the study. despite such limitations, the results of the study provide import- ant ﬁndings for policy makers seeking to improve ado- lescent reproductive health in bangladesh. conclusions and recommendation these results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a health education programme on menstrual hygiene in secondary schools serving rural bangladesh. the pro- gramme produced signiﬁcant positive changes in knowl- edge, beliefs, menstrual hygiene practices, experience of disorders, and restrictions on menstruating adolescents. more intense or longer interventions may be needed to signiﬁcantly improve good menstrual hygiene practice in this population. taking into account the health implica- tions and prevailing socio-cultural and economic factors, effective strategies should be implemented to persuade adolescent school girls to adopt healthy menstrual prac- tices. a well-informed continuous, school education pro- gramme should be delivered to students. in addition, the ﬁndings emphasise that information on safe hygiene and sanitary practices should be included in the school cur- riculum, and that there should be better communication between female students and their teachers, and between daughters and mothers. author affiliations 1uchicago research bangladesh, dhaka, bangladesh 2united nations university-international institute for global health (unu- iigh), kuala lumpur, malaysia 3international health and medicine, division of public health, graduate school of medicine, tokyo medical and dental university, tokyo, japan 4honjo international scholarship foundation, tokyo, japan 5wageningen university, wageningen, the netherlands 6faculty of policy studies, chuo university, tokyo, japan acknowledgements the authors would like to thank all participants, teachers and education officers who helped with this research. we also thank dr nowsheen sharmin purabi, registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at anwer khan medical college, dhaka, bangladesh for her training of, and support for, the research assistants, which made this research possible. contributors seh and ks develop the proposal and implemented the study. ki and mm were involved in the field study. mr and seh carried out the analyses and wrote the manuscript. all authors checked and approved the final manuscript. funding this study was funded by the honjo international scholarship foundation, japan. competing interests none. patient consent obtained. ethics approval the bangladesh medical research council approved this study. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement no additional data are available. open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the creative commons attribution non commercial (cc by-nc 3.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non- commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ references 1. world health organization. adolescent friendly health services. an agenda for change. geneva: world health organization, 2002. 2. mcpherson me, korfine l. menstruation across time: menarche, menstrual attitudes, experiences and behaviors. womens health issues 2004;14:193–200. 3. aniebue uu, aniebue pn, nwankwo to. the impact of pre-menarcheal training on menstrual practices and hygiene of nigerian school girls. pan afr med j 2009;2:9. 4. rokeya a, kabita y. menstrual hygiene: breaking the silence. water aid bangladesh 2007:283–7. 5. dasgupta a, sarkar m. menstrual hygiene: how hygienic is the adolescent girl?
