 - 2 -  abstract   background  clinical experience suggests that many patients with modic changes have relatively  severe and persistent low back pain (lbp), which typically appears to be resistant to  treatment. exercise therapy is the recommended treatment for chronic lbp, however  due to their underlying pathology, modic changes might be a diagnostic subgroup that  does not benefit from exercise. the objective of this study was to compare the current  state-of-the art treatment approach (exercise and staying active) with a new approach  (load reduction and daily rest) for people with modic changes using a randomised  controlled trial design.  methods  participants were patients from an outpatient clinic with persistent lbp and modic  changes. they were allocated using minimisation to either rest therapy for 10 weeks  with a recommendation to rest for two hours daily and the option of using a flexible  lumbar belt or exercise therapy once a week for 10 weeks. follow-up was at 10 weeks  after recruitment and 52 weeks after intervention and the clinical outcome measures  were pain, disability, general health and global assessment, supplemented by weekly  information on low back problems and sick leave measured by short text message  (sms) tracking.  results  in total, 100 patients were included in the study. data on 87 patients at 10 weeks and  96 patients at one-year follow-up was available and used in the intention-to-treat  analysis. no statistically significant differences were found between the two  intervention groups on any outcome.  


 - 3 -  conclusions  no differences were found between the two treatment approaches, ‘rest and reduced  load’ and ‘exercise and staying active’, in patients with persistent lbp and modic  changes.     trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00454792       


 - 4 -  background   exercise therapy is currently the recommended first-line treatment in clinical  guidelines for chronic non-specific low back pain (lbp) [1]. however, a meta- analysis of exercise therapy trials in patients with chronic lbp has shown that despite  statistically significant improvements, the effect size of exercise (mean treatment  effect) was small for pain (7 points out of 100) and disability (3 points out of 100)  compared with no treatment or other conservative treatments[2].  clinical experience suggests that patients with chronic non-specific lbp  can respond very differently to the same treatment. the reasons for this are unknown,  as few studies have been able to identify predictors of a positive outcome[3].  however, one factor that may influence an individual’s response to exercise treatment  is the underlying aetiology of the pain. in the case of chronic non-specific lbp, it is  not unreasonable to expect such pain to be caused by a number of conditions, some of  them involving identifiable pathoanatomical changes. if the same type of treatment  were to be provided for a wide range of different conditions or pathologies, one might  expect the outcomes to be dissimilar. if and how researchers should deal with  subpopulations of lbp has attracted attention in recent years[4] and preliminary  results suggest that targeting treatment for specific lbp subgroups might be more  effective than generic treatments directed towards mixed populations with non- specific lbp[5].   recently, focus has been put on a diagnostic subgroup of lbp, those  with modic changes (mcs). mcs can only be visualised using magnetic resonance  imaging (mri) and have been described as being a stage of the disc degeneration  process[6-9]. modic et al. divided mcs into three types: type i, ii and iii[10,11].  histological studies show that type i consist of fissured endplates and vascular 


 - 5 -  granulation tissue adjacent to the endplate whereas type ii is characterised by a  disruption of the endplates and fatty degeneration of the adjacent bone marrow[10].  type iii seem to be similar to sclerosis of the bone marrow as seen on plain-film  radiographs[11].   a review of the prevalence of mcs and the association with lbp  estimated the median prevalence of mcs in clinical populations at 43% and showed  that mcs are less common in non-clinical populations, with a median prevalence of  6%[12]. positive associations between mcs and lbp were found with odds ratios  (ors) ranging from 2 to 20[12]. more recently, three additional studies[13-15]  reported similar findings, in which ors for the association were 5, 9 and 28.  although believed to be associated with disc degeneration, the precise aetiology of  mcs is unknown. one theory is that mcs are caused by mechanical stress[16]. it has  been shown that disc degeneration alters the biomechanics of the disc[6,17].  excessive loading and shear forces may result in microfractures of the endplate  causing inflammation in the vertebral endplate and the adjacent bone marrow[18,19].  an association has been found between mcs and severely degenerated discs[20-22],  and also with previous disc herniation[23].   our clinical experience suggests that many patients with mcs have  relatively severe and persistent lbp, which is commonly unresponsive to treatment.  furthermore, a retrospective study (an unpublished masters thesis) at the spine centre  of southern denmark, showed that patients with mcs were less likely to improve  with physical activity compared with patients with non-specific lbp[24]. one  hypothesis is that patients with mcs treated with exercise are unlikely to improve  because vigorous weight-bearing exercise might inhibit microfracture healing. this  hypothesis is based on knowledge of treating microfractures in other parts of the 


 - 6 -  body, for example in stress fractures in the lower extremity[25,26]. the extension of  this hypothesis is that patients with lbp and mcs constitute a specific subgroup,  which should not be treated with physical activity. it would be clinically useful to  know if this were true, because the gold standard treatment for patients with persistent  or chronic non-specific lbp is back exercise and encouragement to keep physically  active[1,27].  therefore, we undertook a controlled trial of patients with both mcs and  persistent lbp. the objective of this study was to compare the current ‘state-of-the  art’ treatment approach (exercise and encouragement to keep active) with a new  approach (load reduction and daily rest). the underlying hypothesis for this new  treatment approach was that if vertebral bone microfractures were present in mcs, the  provision of sufficient time and rest to facilitate bone healing would improve patient  outcomes.   methods  trial design   a two-group randomised controlled clinical trial was undertaken.   participants  participants in this study were patients with persistent lbp who attended a specialised  outpatient spine clinic (spine centre of southern denmark) after referral from the  primary care sector. criteria for referral were: (1) back problems with or without  radiculopathy, (2) a maximum of two years’ duration of the current episode, and (3)  previous appropriate but unsuccessful treatment in the primary care sector.  in this clinical setting, from august 2007 to december 2008, mri was  routinely performed[28] on all patients (with no contraindications for mri) meeting  the following criteria: (1) lbp or leg pain of at least 3 on an 11-point numerical 


 - 7 -  rating scale, (2) duration of current symptoms from 2 to 12 months, and (3) age  above 18 years. these criteria were chosen on the basis of previous projects where  there was a high prevalence of mcs.     all patients with an mri showing mcs type i, ii or iii with a  distribution exceeding the endplate, were clinically examined by a researcher (rkj) to  determine if they met the inclusion criteria. the researcher was blinded to subsequent  patient allocation to intervention groups. eligible patients were then informed about  the results of the mri, that mcs were a possible reason for their lbp and invited to  participate in the trial. as directed by the ethics committee for the region of  southern denmark, both written and oral information about the trial was provided to  each patient before admission to the project. this information also contained a  layperson’s explanation of the rationale for both treatment approaches. a team  consisting of a nurse, a medical practitioner, a physiotherapist and a chiropractor  attended participants during the trial if any complications occurred or if any pain  medication required modification.   inclusion and exclusion criteria  patient inclusion criteria were (1) lbp of at least 3 on an 11-point numerical rating  scale, (2) lbp greater than any leg pain present, (3) duration of current symptoms  from 2 to 12 months, (4) age from 18 to 60 years, (5) ability to read and speak danish,  (6) a willingness to participate in the study, and (7) a minimum of one mc (type i, ii  or iii) that extended beyond the endplate into the vertebral body.   patients were excluded if they (1) were unable to participate in the  project because of other physical or mental disorders, (2) had a competing lbp  aetiology such as disc herniation with symptomatic root compression, or (3) had  undergone previous spinal surgery with no pain relief after the operation.  


 - 8 -  mri evaluation  mri was performed with a 0.2 t mri-system (magnetom open viva; siemens ag,  erlangen, germany). a body spine surface coil was used with the patient in the supine  position. the imaging protocol consisted of sagittal and axial t1- and t2-weighted  sequences.  the mri evaluation, at baseline, was performed by a musculoskeletal  radiologist (jss) with extensive mri experience and trained in using the standardised  evaluation protocols[29,30] used in this study. mcs were evaluated according to the  nordic modic consensus group classification[29], which had shown substantial to  almost perfect reproducibility with kappa values for intra-observer reproducibility  (k=0.77 to 1.0) and inter-observer reproducibility (k=0.73 to 0.91).  patients were included if the ‘maximum height’ of the mc extended  beyond the endplate into the vertebral body on the sagittal image (figure 1). this  criterion was chosen to enhance the probability that this mri finding was clinically  relevant and because it had been shown to have high kappa values for intra-observer  reproducibility (k=0.83) and inter-observer reproducibility (k=0.80) [29].   interventions  patients wishing to participate in the project were allocated to one of two groups, the  new treatment approach (rest group) or a comparison treatment (exercise group).   the rest group was instructed to avoid hard physical activity and to rest  twice daily for one hour, by lying down. to imitate the session structure in the  exercise group and thereby the potential effect of being in a group[31], patients met in  a ‘café-like’ environment which provided the opportunity to exchange personal  experiences of pain and physical incapacity. they met in groups of up to a maximum  of 10 people once every second week for 10 weeks for a session of 45 minutes where  they engaged in unstructured talk with a physiotherapist present. to remind the 


 - 9 -  patients not to be physically active and to attempt to support the spine, they were  given an orthopaedic flexible lumbar belt from ‘camp scandinavia’ and were  instructed to use it as needed for up to a maximum of four hours per day. patients  were instructed to use a diary to record separately how many hours a day they were  resting and wearing the lumbar belt. after 10 weeks, patients were instructed to  increase their physical activity gradually until a self-determined acceptable level for  the patient was achieved.   the exercise group received exercises for the stabilising muscles in the  low back and abdomen together with dynamic exercises, exercises for postural  instability and light physical fitness training. the patients exercised in groups of up to  a maximum of 10 people for one hour once a week for 10 weeks guided by a  physiotherapist. they were encouraged to do the same exercises at home three times a  week and to maintain a ‘normal’ level of activity. the patients had the opportunity to  socially interact with each other during the sessions. after 10 weeks of intervention,  the patients were given directions on how to continue their exercise at home. this  intervention represented the normal ‘active’ treatment as recommended in current  clinical guidelines[1,32].   two physiotherapists were assigned to each of the two intervention  groups for the duration of the trial, although only one attended each session. these  four physiotherapists had 12, 15, 20 and 37 years of experience, respectively, working  with back pain patients. for both interventions, two nurses, one for each group,  participated in two of the sessions to discuss pain medication, introduce pain coping  strategies and to tackle ‘unhelpful’ beliefs about lbp. the first session in both groups  started with 20 minutes of information about anatomy and mcs as well as repetition 


 - 10 -  of the rationale for treating mcs with either exercise or rest. only the rationale that  was relevant for the group to which the patient was allocated was explained.    the patients’ attendance was recorded at each session and if they were  absent, they were contacted by a secretary to determine the reason for their non- attendance and to help remove any obstacles to participation. when the patient had  more than 20% absence, she or he was counted as a dropout.   a detailed protocol of procedures and content of the sessions was made  for each intervention group for use by the attending nurses and physiotherapists, to  ensure a uniform and consistent approach to the interventions. there was no overlap  of personnel between the two intervention groups. the interventions ran from august  2007 to april 2009 with an intake of patients every fifth week to ensure that patients  waited a maximum of five weeks from their initial examination to commencement of  their involvement in the intervention.   variables  a booklet of questionnaires was distributed to patients to complete in their own time  at baseline, 10 weeks from baseline (post-treatment) and 12 months from the end of  intervention (one-year follow-up).  variables collected at baseline   mri  information on the presence and type of mcs for 11 endplates from upper l1 to upper  s1 was extracted using the evaluation protocol (nordic modic consensus group  classification[29]).  questionnaires  questionnaire information was collected at baseline (before allocation) containing the  following background variables: age, sex, body mass index (bmi), smoking status,  employment status, type of occupation, education level, whether currently on sick 


 - 11 -  leave and days on sick leave during the previous year. the outcome measures of pain,  disability and general health described below were also contained in the baseline  questionnaire booklet. in addition, information on any ongoing complaint at the  national social appeals board, the patient complaints board of the national health  service or a financial compensation case was collected together with information on  any previous treatment administered in relation to the present episode of lbp. finally,  patients were asked how they would expect the treatment approaches, (rest and  exercise, respectively) to affect their back pain. a five-point likert scale for each  treatment with response options ranging from 1 (much better) to 5 (much worse) was  used as measurement.   variables collected post-treatment (10 weeks) and at one-year follow-up  details on the primary and secondary outcome measures are described in additional  file 1.   primary outcome measure   pain: the numerical rating scale[33] (nrs) measures current back pain on a 0-10  scale.  secondary outcome measures   disability: the roland morris disability questionnaire[34] (rmq) is a 23-item  disability questionnaire with a 0-23 scale, measuring activity limitation.  generic health: euroqol[35-37] (eq-5d) is a standardised instrument measuring  health status-related quality of life consisting of a health status index (eqindex 0-1  scale) and a visual analogue scale (eqvas 0-100 scale).  global assessment: the global assessment transition questionnaire measures the  patients' perception of the overall change in their back pain since the beginning of the  study on a 7-point likert scale[38].  


 - 12 -  depression: beck depression inventory[39] (bdi) is a 21-question inventory  measuring the presence and severity of depressed mood with a 0-63 scale.   sms-track (pain and sick leave): in order to obtain detailed information about each  patient’s clinical course, automated text messages via short message service tracking  (sms-track)[40] were used for data collection. sms-track is a system for data  capture. each week, for 52 weeks starting at baseline, a programmed database sent a  text message to patients’ cell phones containing two questions: “how many days have  you had low back problems during the last week?” and “how many days have you  been on sick leave due to your back problem during the last week?” patients were  instructed to answer from ‘0’ to ‘7’ according to the number of days per week that  were relevant for each question. if the patient did not answer the question within five  days, a text message reminder was automatically sent. if the patient had three or more  missing answers, a secretary called the patient and asked if the patient had any  problems with the technique and if so, tried to solve the problem. the sick leave data  were transformed into a five-day week instead of a seven-day week, by recoding  answers with six or seven days as five days.  additional information  post-treatment and at the one-year follow-up, any adverse events associated with the  treatments, together with a description of any care-seeking for the current back  problem (i.e. having consulted a gp, specialist, chiropractor, physiotherapist, other  care provider or been hospitalised) was also measured.   sample size  a power calculation was made using a data file (unpublished observations) from the  spine centre of southern denmark, which showed that patients with mcs on a  numerical rating scale (0-10) reported an average pain of 6.4 (sd 1.8). the aim was to 


 - 13 -  have 90% power to observe a significant difference (alpha level) of 5%. to ensure a  mean difference of 30% or more between the groups and with an estimated dropout  rate of 20%, we needed to include 38 patients in each group.   randomisation   on receiving the completed baseline questionnaire, the project secretary allocated  each patient into one of the two intervention groups by means of computerised  minimisation software (‘minim’, an ms-dos program[41]). minimisation[42] is a  covariate adaptive randomisation method[43] which aims to ensure that treatment  arms are balanced with respect to certain predefined factors as well as for the number  of patients in each group[44]. the technique has been shown to be a highly effective  allocation method recommended in the conduct of controlled trials particularly when  trial sample sizes are small [44]. variables equally distributed through minimisation  were age (3 groups), sex (2 groups), heavy smoking i.e. ≥20 cigarettes a day (2  groups) and self-reported hard physical work (2 groups). the variables were chosen  for the following reasons: age because activity level and care-seeking might be  influenced by age[45], sex because women more often report some kind of  consequences due to spinal problems than men [45], workload and smoking because  hard physical work in combination with heavy smoking is associated with mcs[46].  a concern about using minimisation is the risk of selection bias due to the potential  for assignment being predicted if the person conducting the minimisation has  knowledge of the characteristics of earlier patients[44]. this was managed by  ensuring that minimisation was consecutive in order of patient registration and by the  task of minimisation being shared between two people. the researchers were masked  to group assignment. 


 - 14 -  blinding  the mri evaluator (jss) was blinded to all patient information except name, sex and  age. this was achieved by sending the images to an external radiologist with no  access to other study data. the researchers analysing the data (rkj and nw) were  blinded to patient identification as the study participants were given a random  identification number when assigned to the project. all researchers were blinded to  identification of the groups until all the analyses were done. the key for identification  of patients and group was concealed by the project secretary.   data management and analysis  comparisons were made of baseline data between the two intervention groups, and  between compliers and non-compliers in each group using t-tests or a non-parametric  equivalent for continuous variables and a chi-square test or fisher exact test for  categorical variables.  all data were analysed using the intention-to-treat (itt) principle,  whereby all patients who returned a questionnaire were included regardless of their  participation in the intervention. in addition, an efficacy subset analysis was carried  out for the primary and secondary outcome measures, selecting the subset of patients  who received their treatment and who did not drop out for any reason.    for the whole study sample, the mean difference between baseline and each of  the two follow-ups for primary and secondary outcome measures were compared  using paired t-tests. a comparison between groups was performed using multiple  linear regression with robust variance estimations. regression models were adjusted  for baseline score and for the following covariates: age, sex, hard physical work and  heavy smoking. the covariates were included because it has been suggested that  factors used for minimisation in the allocation process should be adjusted for in the  analyses [44].  


 - 15 -   the number of patients in each group who achieved a minimal clinically  important difference (mcid) was counted for the pain and disability outcomes using  the raw change score from baseline to follow-up. a potential group difference was  analysed using a chi-square test. mcid values for secondary sector patients from a  study by lauridsen et al.[47] were used, as these mcid values were derived for  patients undergoing standard treatment in the same clinical setting as the current  study. the mcid values were ‘quartile-specific’, which means that the value of  mcid is dependent on the quarter of the scale in which the baseline score is located.  for the pain scale (0-10), the mcid is 1 if the baseline score lies in the first quarter of  the scale (0 to 2.5), 2 if it lies in the second quarter (>2.5 to 5), 4 if it lies in the third  quarter (>5 to 7.5), and 1 if it lies in the fourth quarter (>7.5 to 10). for the rmq  scale (0-23), the mcid is 4 if the baseline score is in the first quarter of the scale (0 to  5.75) and 2 for the second and third quarter (> 5.75 to 23). no quartile-specific value  was available for the fourth quarter, and so an overall score with the value 2 was  used.[47]   items on the 7-point global assessment transition questionnaire were  dichotomised into not better (i.e. reports of ‘much worse’, ‘worse’, ‘a little worse’,  ‘about the same’ and ‘a little better’) and better (i.e. ‘better’ and ‘much better’) and  the proportion of patients who improved in each group was compared using a chi- square test.  when analysing the sms-track data, only patients with a total response  rate of more than 80% were included. generalised estimating equations (gee) were  used to assess any difference between the groups over time with age, sex, hard  physical work and heavy smoking as covariates. further, we counted the total number  of days with back problems over the 52 weeks as a proportion of the maximum 


 - 16 -  number of days possible. the same analysis was performed for the number of days on  sick leave, assuming each working week consisted of 5 days. the groups were  compared using a chi-square test. the sms-track data were also presented visually.  adverse events and care-seeking were reported in raw numbers and percentages.   finally, an analysis was performed investigating if the patients’  expectations of the treatment they received would influence the outcome[48]. the  five-point likert scale for each treatment option was dichotomised into not better (i.e.  reports of ‘much worse’, ‘worse’ or ‘unchanged’), and better (i.e. ‘better’ and ‘much  better’). a dichotomous ‘treatment expectation’ variable was constructed containing  patients who received their preferred treatment and those who did not. a comparison  of the distribution in the two intervention groups was analysed using fisher’s exact  test. thereafter, a regression model was created with intervention group and the  ‘treatment expectation’ variable as the independent variables, and the dependent  variables (outcome variables) of pain, disability and general health. the model was  adjusted for baseline score, age, sex, hard physical work and heavy smoking.  significance (alpha level) was set at 5%. all analyses were performed  using the stata statistical software, version 11.   approval  the study was approved by the ethics committee for the region of southern  denmark, approval # s-vf-20060111 and registered in clinicaltrials.gov identifier #  nct00454792.   results   participant flow  a flow diagram summarising the study process, including drop-out rates and reasons  for drop-out, is illustrated in figure 2. in total, 557 patients were screened with mri 


 - 17 -  and, of those, 244 (44%) had mcs with a ‘maximum height’ extending beyond the  endplate into the vertebral body. of the 244 patients with mcs who were potential  participants, 100 were included in the interventions, and 144 did not meet inclusion  criteria (figure 2). data on 87 patients post-treatment, and 96 patients at one-year  follow-up were available and used in the data analysis (itt).   compliance  at the end of the intervention period, 78 patients had completed the full treatment  program (dropout rate 22%). of those who completed the intervention, two patients  declined participation in the one-year follow-up. in total, 78 patients post-treatment  and 76 patients at one-year follow-up had completed the intervention. these  participants were used in the efficacy analyses.   on average, patients participated in 84% of the sessions in the rest group or  91% of sessions if only those who completed the intervention were considered. in the  exercise group, patients participated in 74% of the sessions or 88% of sessions if only  completers were considered. patients in the rest group rested on average for 1 hour  and 34 minutes per day (range 18-161 min.) and they used the lumbar belt on average  for 1 hour and 33 minutes per day (range 0-291 min.). those who completed the  intervention rested on average 1 hour and 40 minutes per day (range 56-161 min) and  used the belt on average for 1 hour and 34 minutes per day (range 1-291 min).  outcomes and estimation  baseline data  table 1 shows baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the whole study  sample and for each intervention group. there were no significant differences  between the two groups regarding any of the baseline variables, including patient  expectations of treatment effect. patients who dropped out during the intervention did 


 - 18 -  not differ significantly on any baseline variables compared with patients who  completed the intervention.   follow-up data  overall, the efficacy subset analyses on the outcome measures of pain, disability,  general health and global assessment did not produce results that were different from  the results of the itt analyses and therefore only the results of the itt analyses will  be reported.   primary and secondary outcomes  there were no differences between the two intervention groups for any of the  outcomes of pain, disability, general health, depression, global assessment or the  number of patients achieving an mcid. estimates are summarised in table 2 and  table 3. the pre- and post-treatment bdi variables were found not to follow a normal  distribution, and therefore a square root transformation was performed, which  effectively corrected the skew. table 2 reports the untransformed scores to assist with  clinical interpretation and the results from both transformed and untransformed  analysis for comparison.   seventy-nine patients had an sms response rate of more than 80% and the  following results are reported for those patients regardless of intervention drop-out  status. the regression analysis of the sms-track data showed no significant  difference between intervention groups for either lbp problems or sick leave. the  total number of days with lbp problems was 70% of the maximum possible days for  the rest group and 68% for the exercise group with no significant difference between  the groups. the total number of days on sick leave was 24% of the total possible days  for the rest group and 33% for the exercise group with no significant difference  between the groups. for visual interpretation of the sms-track data, see figure 3 for  days with low back problems and figure 4 for days on sick leave. 


 - 19 -  additional information   additional treatment for lbp  post-treatment, 8 patients (18%) in the rest group and 10 (26%) in the exercise group  had sought additional consultations or treatments from external care providers for  their current back problem. at one-year follow-up, the proportion of patients seeking  additional care had risen to 30 (64%) in the rest group and 23 (50%) in the exercise  group. this difference was not statistically significant at either time-point (see table  4).  reported adverse events  no serious problems were reported post-treatment but in the rest group, 2 patients  reported that they found it stressful to find the time to rest two hours a day, 3 reported  increased pain and 2 reported pain from wearing the lumbar belt. in the training  group, 5 patients complained about increasing pain after training sessions and 1  reported one episode of peripheralisation of the pain. at one-year follow-up, there  were no reported adverse events from the interventions.   expectations  the distribution of patients who received the treatment of which they had positive  expectations was equally distributed between the intervention groups (67% in the rest  group and 75% in the exercise group, p=0.4). receiving the intervention that a patient  had positive expectations of was not associated with outcome in pain, disability or  general health compared with those who received a treatment they did not expect to  be effective.   secondary observations  when the whole study sample was considered, a statistically significant but small  improvement was found in most of the outcome measures (see table 5). the global  assessment showed that post-treatment, 12 patients (14%) rated themselves ‘better’ or  ‘much better’ and at one-year follow-up, this was 23 patients (24%). 


 - 20 -   compliance with rest and use of the lumbar belt varied considerably. it is  plausible that patients with a high compliance would have a better outcome. however,  a post-hoc analysis (data not shown) indicated that those who rested the most (top  30%) were no different in outcome for pain and disability than those with poorer  compliance in the rest group.  discussion   main findings   there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment approaches  for any outcome measure at any of the time-points.   methodological considerations   the study might have been strengthened by the inclusion of a control group consisting  of a ‘no treatment’ group. however, as participants were all seeking care for their  lbp and as reviews and international guidelines recommend exercise as effective  first-line treatment for chronic lbp[1,27,49], exercise therapy was used as the  comparative treatment.   all patients were referred from primary care where treatment, including  exercise, had been attempted in 53% of the patients. it is reasonable to assume that the  exercise treatment had been ineffective since the patients were referred for secondary  care. it is possible that this could have negatively affected the patients’ expectations  of exercise treatment, however this was not reflected in the analysis concerning the  patients’ expectations of treatment.   reflections on the new treatment approach (rest group)  in this study, the novel intervention being investigated consisted of a combination of  rest and a lumbar belt. evidence does not endorse this approach for non-specific lbp 


 - 21 -  but we were targeting this treatment to a pathoanatomic-specific subgroup based on a  biologically plausible hypothesis about the aetiology of the pain.   some physicians use mcs as an indication for prescribing lumbar belts as  treatment for lbp[50] but the rest approach has not been investigated previously for  people with both lbp and mcs and therefore, the effectiveness of this treatment  could not be anticipated. although a recent cochrane review reported that ‘it is still  unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for the  treatment of lbp’[51], we were unable to find studies investigating the clinical effect  of using a lumbar belt specifically as treatment for mcs.    the duration of the intervention for the rest group was selected to allow time  for microfracture healing[52] and to match the duration of the exercise intervention.  the number of hours that the patients were advised to rest per day was arbitrary but it  was designed to allow participants to maintain normal work hours and to preclude the  necessity for sick leave.   reflections on the comparison treatment (exercise group)  a previous study of patients with non-specific lbp at our centre compared physical  training with education[53] and had patient selection criteria similar to the current  study. the physical training group had a 25% improvement in pain and an 8%  improvement in disability at one-year follow-up. in the current study, the exercise  group improved 16% for pain and 21% for disability and, therefore, the improvement  follows a similar trend to that reported by others in a comparable study population.   there is no compelling evidence that any particular type of exercise is more  effective than another for the treatment of chronic lbp[54]. to expedite the study, the  content of the exercise intervention was similar to that already provided at the spine  centre of southern denmark. one guideline recommends that the duration of an 


 - 22 -  exercise program be a minimum of 12 weeks[32] but for logistical reasons we were  constrained to 10 weeks, which might have been a limitation.    the exercise group in the current study had supervised sessions only once a  week. members were encouraged to do home exercises three times a week in which  they had been instructed. compliance with home exercise is generally considered to  be poor[55,56], and supervision by a therapist is therefore recommended[54].  compliance with performing the exercise program at home was not measured and the  dosage unknown. the low frequency of supervised exercise sessions (once a week) is  not optimal and could have influenced the effectiveness of the exercise therapy.   the individual preference of the physiotherapists and nurses involved in the  intervention was unmeasured but may have influenced the outcome of the treatment.  both intervention approaches had face validity and the rationale for the study was  communicated to all members of the study team. blinding the therapists from the  study hypothesis was not realistic and could potentially create bias, as the personal  ‘belief’ in one rationale over another could have been projected onto the participants.  however, the therapists involved had had substantial experience, as multiple studies  have been conducted at the spine centre previously and they were aware of the risk.  results and hypothesis  the absence of a between-group difference in this study challenges its underlying  assumptions and hypothesis. firstly, we had assumed that mcs were the cause of pain  in this patient cohort. however, it is likely that spine-related pathoanatomical changes  other than mcs or perhaps psychosocial factors may have influenced or caused the  pain. secondly, if mcs were the main cause of pain in this cohort and if rest were  useful, the dosage may have been insufficient. it is possible that a few hours of rest a  day is not sufficient to counteract the load induced by the activities of daily life. 


 - 23 -  thirdly, mcs consist of histologically different subtypes and it may be that subgroups  of type, size and location of mcs could respond differently to treatment. such a  subanalysis of predictive factors for outcome will be reported in another paper. lastly,  the underlying hypothesis that mcs are caused by a biomechanical alteration of the  disco-vertebral complex could be inadequate. other hypotheses of explanatory  pathoanatomic pathways exist, such as the possibility that the inflammation seen on  mri in mcs is caused by low virulent bacteria[16].    there was a small yet statistically significant improvement at both time-points  for pain and disability at a whole group level. however, because we did not include a  ‘no treatment’ group, we were not able to test whether the slight improvement  occurring in both groups was due to an equal treatment effect in both groups or if the  treatments had no effect and the improvement was a consequence of the natural  course. also, as this study sample consisted of patients with mcs only, we do not  know if the overall poor prognosis is unique for this subpopulation. to explore this  would require a different study design including patients both with and without mcs.   implications  by introducing the rest approach there may have been a risk of maintaining unwanted  behaviours such as poor coping strategies, kinesiophobia, anxiety and  catastrophisation as studies have indicated that exercise treatment reduces some of  these behaviours[57-59]. the potential psychosocial implications of the new approach  might not have been sufficiently measured in this study, but we did not find a  difference in emotional functioning (measured with bdi) between the groups.  although exercise was not superior to the rest approach in the current study, the  concept of exercise and keeping active might have more general beneficial effects for  physical and mental health. in addition, exercise is a well established treatment for 


 - 24 -  chronic lbp and the results of this single study are not sufficient to recommended rest  as an equal alternative for patients with mcs. however, based on our findings, it is  reasonable to consider the possibility that not all subgroups of patients with persistent  non-specific lbp will benefit to the same extent from exercise. furthermore, when  the relatively small effect sizes of conservative treatment (including exercise) for non- specific lbp in general are taken into account, we recommend that the resource  consumption of treatment programs should be considered as a secondary outcome in  future research. in addition, we recommend more research in the area of identifying  subgroups that could more effectively benefit from the treatment provided.  conclusions   there was no statistically significant difference on any outcome measure between the  treatment approach of rest and reduced load and the conventional approach of  exercise and staying active.   competing interests  the authors declare that they have no competing interests.  authors' contributions  rkj participated in conception and design, carried out the data collection and the  analyses, and wrote the main parts of the manuscript. cly, nw and cm participated  in conception and design and made substantial contributions to the manuscript. jss  made a substantial contribution to the acquisition of data and revising the manuscript.  all authors have given their final approval of the version to be published.  acknowledgements   the authors are grateful to the velux foundation, a non-profit foundation for  funding this project. the authors thank physiotherapist hanne rasmussen, dorit
