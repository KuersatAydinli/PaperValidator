drug interventions feature routinely in many disease guidelines. currently, the model for managing chronic diseases focuses on treating individual conditions, and patients may on the one hand beneﬁt from the drug treatment of each of their chronic conditions; however, there is a risk of multiple drug therapy, side effects and drug interactions which could in combination be detrimental.6 7 many national healthcare policies have developed fra- meworks for chronic disease models of care and speciﬁc guidelines for the optimal management of chronic dis- eases. examples include policy and guidelines for the common conditions in the general population with dia- betes, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstruct- ive airways disease and depression.8–12 in addition, these guidelines are beginning to be adapted for the common experience of comorbid conditions, particularly by older people, for each of these individual conditions.13 since people with one or more chronic conditions are increas- ing in number, this has increasingly brought in focus the scale and quantity of multiple drug prescribing in general populations. the key questions then become (1) how does multiple drug prescribing for different systems relate to the primary index condition and (2) how does multiple drug prescribing escalate when populations experience multiple conditions which might be directly linked or occur by chance together. the cardiometa- bolic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, share aetiology and common drug treatment pathways, but it is still import- ant to understand the scale of multiple drug therapy that might be associated when these conditions co-occur together in the same individual. many chronic diseases also have conditions which are related to mechanisms other than pathophysiology. for example, other common chronic conditions include chronic obstructive airways disease and depression, and this epidemiology provides the scale of multiple drug therapies when co-occurring conditions might be unrelated. in terms of the current evidence in this ﬁeld, much of it has focused around ‘polypharmacy’ studies.14–16 however, while this might seem an appropriate broad umbrella term, in research and clinical approaches, it has often focused on arbitrarily chosen number of drugs, and linked the term to either inappropriate pre- scribing or associated adverse events in older popula- tions.16 this lack of consensus deﬁned approach to this problem has led to an argument for less ambiguous ter- minology,17 and we propose that ‘multidrug’ therapy is used to link in with the standard approach to two or more conditions, which is ‘multimorbidity’. within this evidence, there is still a clear gap in how morbidity link to drug prescribing, and whether comorbidity inﬂuences the drug prescribing for an index disease. in this study, the focus was on six common chronic conditions in the general population, which included diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascu- lar diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd), osteoarthritis (oa) and depression. the choice of these chronic conditions for the purpose of the study was based on a number of factors including the epidemiology, especially prevalence of the diseases, as well as aetiopathogenesis and impacts on quality of life and psychological well-being. for example, while dia- betes mellitus, coronary heart disease and cerebrovascu- lar diseases have a common pathological basis of causation (the ‘vascular group’), and often coexist in one patient, they are also known to have high mortality rates—hence the drive towards measures aimed at opti- mising the management of these diseases.18 19 the other three non-vascular chronic conditions—copd, oa and depression—are leading causes of morbidity, high cost of care and psychological distress, respect- ively.20–22 the rationale for our focus on few selected common conditions was also to provide common comorbidity combinations which are potentially treated with drugs as a key intervention. we investigated two separate issues using the selected group of vascular and non-vascular conditions. first, we wanted to investigate the relative multidrug prescribing for each of six chosen index examples, comparing comorbid groups with prescribing levels in the respect- ive index groups. second, we wanted to test whether vas- cular comorbidity inﬂuenced key drug prescribing for chosen conditions. the vascular group was likely to be on similar multiple drugs, so the distinct hypothesis was tested, that was drug prescribing in vascular conditions overall may inﬂuence key drug prescribing in the indi- vidual non-vascular conditions of copd, oa or depression. methods design and study population the cross-sectional study was conducted using two linked databases on patients aged 40 years and over pre- senting to general practice over a 2-year time period (from 1 january 2002 to 31 december 2003). we wanted to investigate what multidrug prescribing levels were before a national uk performance-based incentive (quality outcomes framework) was implemented to test the associations between comorbidity and routine multi- drug prescribing. settings the clinical and prescription databases analysed were derived from an anonymised computer-recorded consul- tations from 11 general practices from the north staffordshire keele gp research partnership. the part- nership covers a range of practices covering varying socio- economic groups within rural and urban areas and has been involved in data collection over time for the purpose of epidemiological studies. there is an ongoing process of data validation to improve data quality, and there is evidence that this measure improves data record- ing by general practitioners (gps) and their teams.23 2 roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429.

chronic disease data the consultation in primary care archive (cipca) data- base focuses on the routinely collected morbidity encounters in actual consultations and coded using a standard clinical classiﬁcation (read codes).24 patients who had a record of a disease-speciﬁc read coded mor- bidity of interest were included in the study and the main codes were used with all associated ‘daughter codes’. the main read codes that were used to deﬁne the chronic disease groups were: diabetes mellitus (read codes c10), cardiovascular diseases (ischaemic heart disease (g3); heart failure (g58), excluding hyper- tension), cerebrovascular diseases (g6), copd (h30, excluding asthma), oa (n05, excluding arthralgia) and depression (e11, e20, eu and excluding psychosis). comorbidity: definitions there were two approaches to deﬁning comorbidity. first, comorbidity was deﬁned as the presence of one of the other ﬁve selected conditions. so using the diabetes population as an example, the diabetes ‘index’ group was deﬁned as diabetes ‘alone’ and without anyone of the other ﬁve conditions, whereas diabetes ‘comorbid’ group was deﬁned as at least one of the other ﬁve condi- tions. the index ‘alone’ group would also enable the capture of the other morbidity that was outside of the ones within the study. this deﬁnition was applied to each of the six chronic conditions individually. second, in the vascular group, comorbidity was deﬁned separ- ately as the individual and speciﬁc addition of copd, oa or depression, and irrespective of whether the latter three occurred together. prescribed drug measure: overall multidrug count definitions the prescriptions in primary care archive (pipca) data- base focuses on the routinely collected prescribed medi- cations and which were coded using the british national formulary (bnf) classiﬁcation.25 the bnf consists of 15 main chapters based on the systems of the body, and within which there are further subsections for speciﬁc clinical indications. only patients on repeat drug pre- scriptions were selected for deﬁning measures because this gives a better representation of multiple drugs used on a long-term basis for the majority of patients with chronic conditions. speciﬁc drug treatment chapters for the six chronic diseases of interest in the study were identiﬁed and used as a summary of multidrug counts. the bnf chapter for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs was under bnf chapter 2, for copd drugs under chapter 3, for depression under chapter 4, for diabetes mellitus under chapter 6 and for oa under chapters 4 and 10. this means that overall, there were ﬁve main bnf chapters, which could constitute a measure of drug counts of up to a total of 5. the multidrug count deﬁnition in this approach would then speciﬁcally relate to people prescribed drugs from at least two or more of the ﬁve chapters indicated. vascular comorbidity and drug prescribing for non-vascular conditions the key likelihood of receiving drug treatments for the speciﬁc conditions of copd, oa and depression in the study population with vascular comorbidity was also investigated. in this approach, the ‘vascular’ comorbidity was deﬁned as the group any one of diabetes, cardiovas- cular disease and cerebrovascular disease. the non- vascular groups were then individually compared with and without vascular comorbidity. for example, the copd group was compared with vascular comorbidity to the copd without vascular comorbidity, in relation to the likelihood of receiving copd-speciﬁc drug treatment. while the key drug treatments for copd, oa and depression can be examined in different ways such as the use of speciﬁc drugs, or drug doses and duration of drug therapy, we wanted to ﬁrst establish the simplest likelihood of a patient given any one of the key group of drugs for copd, oa or depression. the group of drugs derived from guidelines for copd10 included broncho- dilators, corticosteroids, inhaled steroids and oxygen (bnf sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6). the group of drugs for oa26 included non-opioid analgesics, opioid analge- sics, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatories and cox 2 inhibi- tors (bnf sections 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 10.1.1 and 10.1.2.2). the group of drugs for depression11 included hypnotics, anxiolytics and antidepressants (bnf sections 4.1 and 4.3). analysis the ﬁrst analysis was to describe the 2-year period preva- lence of the ﬁve main bnf chapters in the speciﬁed chronic disease population, with a focus on some of the common drugs that were prescribed within each chapter expressed as drug prevalence/10 000 population aged 40 years and over, and differences were assessed using χ2 tests. the ﬁve main chapter drug categories prevalence is described by age, gender and deprivation status. deprivation was measured by the index of multiple deprivation (imd) which is a composite score that is linked to postal address codes.27 the imd score was categorised into the bottom 20% (most deprived), middle 60% and the top 20% score (most afﬂuent). for each of the six chronic conditions, associations between the comorbid groups and higher multidrug counts were compared with the respective reference ‘alone’ group. the ‘outcome’ of higher multidrug therapy was deﬁned as 3 or more of the chapter counts and compared with 2 counts or less. associations using logistic regression were expressed as ors with 95% cis, and also included the ratios comparing prevalence of each drug count category in the comorbid group com- pared with the ‘alone’ group. then for the vascular group, associations between each of the comorbid group roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005429 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published

with copd, oa or depression were compared with the vascular ‘alone’ alone, and higher multidrug counts were then estimated. finally, the data were analysed for the study deﬁned optimal drug treatments for copd, oa or depression. three study groups constructed were: copd with at least one of the vascular conditions; oa with at least one of the vascular conditions and depression with at least one of the vascular conditions. each group was then compared to their respective vascular group, for example, copd and vascular group compared with copd without a vascular condition, by the speciﬁc optimal drug treatment. association estimates using logistic regression are presented as unadjusted and adjusted ﬁgures with 95% cis. analyses were carried out using spss v.17.0 statistical software. results study population in the study population of 12 875 aged 40 years and over, the numbers of patients prescribed with cardiovas- cular system drugs were 9384 (2-year time period preva- lence 73%), respiratory system drugs were 2861 (22%), non-opioid analgesia were 5395 (42%), antidepressants were 3241 (25%), antidiabetic drugs were 2916 (23%) and musculoskeletal system anti-inﬂammatory drugs were 2143 (17%; table 1). in terms of the sociodemographic distribution, older patients aged 70 years and over and populations in the top 20% most deprived status were signiﬁcantly more likely to be prescribed all main drug categories, except for the cardiovascular system (χ2 test for trend p<0.001). for women compared with men, there was variation by type of main drug category; the comparative 2-year prevalence ﬁgures by gender were signiﬁcantly higher for men compared with women for the cardiovascular system drugs (76% vs 70%) and diabetes (26% vs 20%), but similar for copd (p=0.462). prevalence ﬁgures were lower for men compared with women for anxioly- tics and antidepressants (49% vs 66%) and anti- inﬂammatories (15% vs 18%; χ2 test p<0.001; table 2). individual chronic condition comorbidity and higher multidrug counts for all six speciﬁed chronic conditions, at lower drugs counts of up to 2, the prevalence numbers were greater for the individual groups without the other ﬁve comorbid conditions compared with the numbers for the individual conditions with comorbidity of other ﬁve conditions (table 3). for the drug count of 2 different chapters, the comorbid to ‘alone’ ratios ranged from 1.15 for the depression group to 0.5 for the diabetes group. the prevalence ratios were highest for the multi- drug count of 4, and these ranged from 13.7 for the depression comorbid group to 2.3 for the diabetes comorbid group. adjusting for age, gender and deprivation, the associa- tions between the comorbid groups and higher multi- drug count compared with their respective ‘alone’ group ordered by strength of association were: or 7.1 (95% ci 5.6 to 9.0) for depression, or 5.4 (95% ci 4.6 to 6.3) for cardiovascular disease, or 3.7 (95% ci 2.8 to 5.0) for cerebrovascular disease, or 3.6 (95% ci 3.1 to 4.3) for oa, or 3.5 (95% ci 3.0 to 4.2) for diabetes and or 3.2 (95% ci 2.6 to 4.0) for copd. vascular condition comorbidity and higher multidrug counts the prevalence ratios for the multidrug count of 5 ranged from 3.9 for vascular group comorbid with oa to 1.9 for vascular group comorbid with copd and 1.0 for the vascular group comorbid with depression (table 4). adjusting for age, gender and deprivation, the associations between the comorbid groups and higher multigroup count compared with their respective ‘alone’ group ordered by strength of association were: or 4.6 (95% ci 3.8 to 5.7) for vascular group comorbid with copd, or 3.2 (95% ci 2.6 to 3.9) for vascular group comorbid with depression and or 3.0 (95% ci 2.6 to 3.5) for vascular group comorbid with oa. comorbid vascular conditions and optimal non-vascular condition prescribing the three speciﬁc non-vascular groups of copd, oa and depression were compared with comorbid vascular conditions to without such vascular comorbidity in terms of their respective optimal drug treatment (table 5). adjusting for age, gender and deprivation, the associ- ation between the copd and vascular comorbid groups compared with their respective group without vascular conditions showed a signiﬁcant reduction in optimal copd drug treatment with an or of 0.6 (95% ci 0.4 to 0.8). adjusting for age, gender and deprivation, the asso- ciation between the depression and vascular comorbid groups compared with their respective group without vascular conditions showed a signiﬁcant reduction in optimal depression drug treatment with an or of 0.6 (95% ci 0.4 to 0.7). adjusting for age, gender and deprivation, the association between the oa and vascu- lar comorbid groups compared with their respective group without vascular conditions did not show a statis- tically signiﬁcant reduction in optimal oa drug treat- ment with an or of 0.8 (95% ci 0.6 to 1.1). discussion our ﬁndings from a large cross-sectional study of nearly 13 000 patients aged 40 years and over with one of six speciﬁed and common chronic conditions showed the scale of multidrug prescribing, which was higher in the presence of comorbidity compared with the respective index groups. while previous evidence has shown the high levels of multiple drug prescribing,15 our study 4 roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005429 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


ﬁndings link the disease and comorbidity status to the measure of multidrug prescribing for different systems. depending on whether the chronic conditions were vascular (diabetes, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular) or non-vascular (copd, oa or depression), the higher levels of multidrug prescribing varied. all six conditions with comorbidity compared with their index condition had much higher multidrug count, even adjusting for age, gender and deprivation. the measure of multidrug count was notably distinct by the use of ﬁve different main drug chapter categories which were for different body systems, which means that this ‘outcome’ was not about multiple drug use for the same condition. for example, a diabetic with a higher multidrug count of 4 or 5 in this study relates to different and distinct body systems, and not to the different drugs under the same chapter. the chronic condition of depression comorbid- ity had the strongest strength of association with higher multidrug counts, followed by cardiovascular disease comorbidity, and the estimates of association for cere- brovascular disease, oa and diabetes were similar. these ﬁndings suggest that the index condition and associated comorbidity may inﬂuence the range of multidrug pre- scribing, and generates the interesting hypothesis that potential variation in clinical outcomes of the index con- ditions is as a result of underlying comorbid drug prescribing. the study also grouped the vascular-related conditions to investigate the inﬂuence of non-vascular drug pre- scribing compared with vascular conditions ‘alone’ (ie, without any one of copd, oa or depression). again, the adjusted associations were signiﬁcant, with vascular comorbidity being associated with higher multi drug counts compared with the respective ‘vascular index’ group. here the clinical implication is that vascular comorbidity in populations aged 40 years and over might not only be associated with multiple vascular drugs as routinely suggested by clinical guidelines28 but table 1 prescribed drug prevalence by bnf main chapter and specific sections bnf chapter bnf subsections bnf classification drug examples number drug prevalence/ 10 000† 2 cardiovascular system 9384 7289 2.9 antiplatelet drugs aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole 5044 3918 2.8 anticoagulants warfarin 669 520 2.2 diuretics thiazide diuretics 4912 3815 2.4 β-blockers bisoprolol 4034 3133 2.5 ace inhibitors or arb ramipril, candesartan 4250 3301 2.6 nitrates, calcium antagonists gtn, amlodipine 4984 3817 2.12 lipid regulating drugs simvastatin 4894 3801 3 respiratory system 2861 2222 3.1 bronchodilators salbutamol 2775 2155 3.2 corticosteroids beclomethasone 2140 1662 3.6 oxygen na 94 73 4 central nervous system drugs 7478 5808 4.7.1 non-opioid analgesics paracetamol 5395 4190 4.7.2 opioid analgesics codeine, tramadol 855 664 4.1 hypnotics and anxiolytics diazepam 1180 917 4.3 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants fluoxetine, citalopram, amitriptyline 3241 2517 6 endocrine system 2916 2265 6.1.1 insulin insulin, humalog 632 491 6.1.2 oral antidiabetic drugs metformin, gliclazide 2334 1805 10 musculoskeletal and joint disease 2143 1664 10.1.1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, cyclooxygenase inhibitors 2143 1664 †population refers to those with one of six chronic conditions (n = 12 875), which included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis and depression; drug categories are based on the bnf classification. ace, angiotensin-converting-enzyme; arb, angiotensin ii receptor blockers; bnf, british national formulary; gtn, glyceryl trinitrate; na, not applicable. roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005429 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


by a range of conditions such as comorbidity of copd, oa or depression. it is possible that these conditions and the drug treatments for them may also in the end inﬂuence the health and healthcare outcomes of the index vascular conditions.29 in terms of the inﬂuence of comorbidity on key drug prescribing, our study ﬁndings show that vascular comorbidity in copd and depression is associated with lower likelihood of drug prescribing for the respective conditions of copd and depression. similar ﬁndings, particularly for suboptimal depression drug treatment, when depression is comorbid with chronic disease have been shown previously.30 31 however, such ﬁndings for oa were not found, and here it is possible that the study deﬁnition of analgesia was too broad, as analgesia use covers a range of other painful conditions, in addition to oa. although the key drug deﬁnition was simple and broad, our study ﬁndings seem to suggest that comorbid- ity does inﬂuence drug prescribing for speciﬁc condi- tions. whether this is due to some kind of therapeutic inertia or is due to gps’ reasoned consideration of drug–drug and drug–disease interactions and the overall table 2 sociodemographic characteristics of the main drug categories factor total numbers main drug categories cardiovascular system respiratory system central nervous system endocrine system musculoskeletal system age (years) 40–54 2738 1257 (46) 441 (16) 1447 (53) 555 (20) 378 (14) 55–69 4963 3712 (75) 1131 (23) 2694 (54) 1250 (25) 1003 (20) 70–84 4459 3807 (85) 1154 (26) 2824 (63) 1010 (23) 703 (16) 85 and over 715 608 (85) 135 (19) 513 (72) 101 (14) 59 (8) gender women 6896 4813 (70) 1510 (22) 4528 (66) 1351 (20) 1260 (18) men 5979 4571 (76) 1351 (23) 2950 (49) 1565 (26) 883 (15) deprivation* deprived status 2609 1952 (75) 780 (30) 1705 (65) 695 (27) 474 (18) middle status 7228 5308 (73) 1538 (21) 4184 (58) 1616 (22) 1223 (17) affluent status 2203 1584 (72) 354 (16) 1185 (54) 419 (19) 377 (17) *deprivation measured by index of multiple of deprivation, figures in brackets refer to the percentage of each study factor subgroup. table 3 associations between individual study groups and higher multidrug counts conditions multidrug number/10 000 population adjusted or (95% ci)0 1 2 3 4 5 diabetes ‘alone’* 239 1178 4332 3120 1021 110 1.0 diabetes comorbidity 58 492 2208 4523 2353 366 3.50 (3.0 to 4.2) prevalence ratio† 0.2 0.4 0.5 1.5 2.3 3.3 chd ‘alone’* 148 4057 4248 1372 160 16 1.0 chd comorbidity 36 1027 3973 3516 1327 121 5.35 (4.6 to 6.3) prevalence ratio† 0.2 0.3 0.9 2.6 8.3 7.6 cvd ‘alone’* 688 4087 3848 1306 70 0 1.0 cvd comorbidity 41 1745 4251 3224 678 62 3.70 (2.8 to 5.0) prevalence ratio† 0.1 0.4 1.1 2.5 9.7 na copd ‘alone’* 940 2487 3496 2726 350 0 1.0 copd comorbidity 189 946 2855 4117 1751 142 3.22 (2.6 to 4.0) prevalence ratio† 0.20 0.4 0.8 1.5 5.00 na oa ‘alone’* 1378 2786 3722 1854 256 5 1.0 oa comorbidity 174 1260 3550 3420 1325 271 3.64 (3.1 to 4.3) prevalence ratio† 0.1 0.5 1.0 1.8 5.2 54 depression ‘alone’* 1912 4140 3093 776 79 0 1.0 depression comorbidity 325 1422 3555 3555 1082 62 7.11 (5.6 to 9.0) prevalence ratio† 0.17 0.34 1.15 4.58 13.7 na *alone—people with disease alone and none of the other five morbidities, comorbidity is 1 or more of other five study morbidities. †prevalence ratio=2-year drug count prevalence in the comorbid group/2-year drug count prevalence in the disease alone group; adjusted for age, gender and deprivation and estimates are with the ‘outcome’ of higher drug count (3–4 combined) compared to lower drug counts (2 or less) chd, coronary heart disease; copd, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; cvd, cerebrovascular disease; na, not applicable; oa, osteoarthritis. 6 roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005429 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


well-being of the patient is the important question raised by the ﬁndings. the approach taken to look at speciﬁc groups and six common conditions was based on a combination of clin- ical rationale and feasibility. while, one could have inves- tigated any number of combinations of the six conditions, the better and preferred approach taken was to group conditions ﬁrst at the ‘vascular’ level. as high- lighted earlier, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease have shared pathogenesis and there may be overlapping of drug treatments. however, the ‘non-vascular’ group constitutes individual chronic conditions with distinct and unrelated drug treatments. this approach enabled comorbidity deﬁnitions based on (1) group-level, that is, vascular comorbidity with one of the non-vascular conditions and (2) counts, that is, number of other conditions for each of the six index groups. the study focus was also on comorbidity and further research is also required on how multimorbidity, deﬁned as two or more conditions, inﬂuences the overall prescribing of multiple drugs and when the unit of analysis for outcome is not the disease but the argu- ably more important patient-centred outcomes. the large scale study of speciﬁed chronic diseases was conducted using an anonymised database for a 2-year time period. in terms of the cross-sectional associations, the ﬁndings on the levels of chronic conditions, comorbidity and multidrug prescribing do offer clinical implications as outlined earlier. however, the implica- tions of the associations between comorbidity and the key drug deﬁnitions may be limited in this cross- sectional design and these may be treated cautiously as emergent ﬁndings. the chronic disease deﬁnitions were also based on routinely collected registers from general practices, which were and are part of a research network dedicated to the collection of clinical data in actual con- sultation. while these chronic disease registers may be subject to variations in recording,32 the study analyses provide the estimates of association in actual clinical practice across 11 different sites. the drug deﬁnitions were based on routinely coded repeat prescriptions and over a 2-year time period repre- sent an appropriate measure at the simpler but distinct broad system category. patients however will also have been prescribed other drug categories outside of the ﬁve main categories that we had selected and for other less common conditions from the ones selected in the study, which means these drug levels are a speciﬁc esti- mate. the construction of our study deﬁned index or ‘alone’ groups (without the other ﬁve conditions) pro- vided the relative multidrug level estimates to when the index condition was comorbid with one of the other ﬁve conditions. so the multidrug levels in the ‘alone’ group provide an estimate of main drug system prescribing without the associated condition (ie, for other indica- tions) compared to levels when there is a clear table 4 associations between vascular comorbidity groups and higher multidrug counts conditions multidrug number/10 000 population adjusted or (95% ci)0 1 2 3 4 5 vascular group only* 199 2373 4018 2547 773 89 1.0 vascular group and copd 85 677 2854 4207 2008 169 4.63 (3.8 to 5.7) prevalence ratio 0.43 0.29 0.71 1.65 2.60 1.90 vascular group and oa 29 873 3493 3697 1557 349 3.01 (2.6 to 3.5) prevalence ratio 0.15 0.37 0.87 1.45 2.01 3.92 vascular group and depression 69 829 3733 3917 1359 92 3.22 (2.6 to 3.9) prevalence ratio 0.35 0.35 0.93 1.54 1.76 1.03 *vascular group only is the reference group without copd, oa or depression; prevalence ratio is comparing vascular comorbid group with vascular group alone for each drug count category, adjusted for age, gender and deprivation and estimates are with the ‘outcome’ of higher drug count (3–4 combined) compared with lower drug counts (2 or less). copd, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; oa, osteoarthritis. table 5 key drug treatments of non-vascular conditions in vascular comorbidity numbers (%) key drug treatments* unadjusted or (95% ci) adjusted or (95% ci)no yes copd without vascular comorbidity 123 (22) 937 (88) 1.0 1.0 copd and vascular comorbidity 87 (19) 382 (81) 0.58 (0.43 to 0.78) 0.55 (0.40 to 0.75) oa without vascular comorbidity 281 (16) 1440 (84) 1.0 1.0 oa and vascular comorbidity 117 (17) 568 (83) 0.95 (0.75 to 1.20) 0.82 (0.64 to 1.06) depression without vascular comorbidity 259 (16) 1378 (84) 1.0 1.0 depression and vascular group 120 (28) 311 (72) 0.49 (0.38 to 0.62) 0.55 (0.42 to 0.73) *drug treatment for copd, oa or depression, respectively, adjusted for age, gender and deprivation as measured by index of multiple deprivation. copd, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; oa, osteoarthritis. roberts er, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005429. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005429 7 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


comorbidity record. however, this is time deﬁned by a 2-year time window, so some misclassiﬁcation may be possible and further research could explore how broad system drug deﬁnitions capture the underlying and spe- ciﬁc common diagnostic categories. further research is also required for the arguably more complex assimilation of the range of deﬁned drug categories, other multimor- bidity and to investigate speciﬁc effect of individual drug categories. most of these drugs, other than analgesia such as anti-inﬂammatories, are not available over-the-counter and are usually clinician prescribed. so it is possible that common over-the-counter drugs, particularly in relation to oa, may be an underestimate; however, the selection of repeated prescribing would mitigate against such underestimation. finally, although a large scale study, these general practices are drawn from one region of england, and while this might limit generalisability, the internal validity of the ﬁndings still remains. in conclusion, our study ﬁndings show the links between common chronic conditions, comorbidity and associated multidrug prescribing. the key and distinct ﬁnding is that the study shows that multidrug prescrib- ing deﬁned by a range of selected but different systems is high in chronic conditions and higher in comorbidity. the common groups of vascular conditions are not the only ones associated with their ‘own’ guideline driven multidrug therapy, but the addition of non-vascular con- ditions such as copd, oa and depression adds to the multidrugs burden in patients. the importance of these ﬁndings, in addition to quantifying the scale, is whether such multidrug therapy inﬂuences the quality of care for each of the individual conditions. our ﬁndings suggest that the potential for suboptimal drug treatment as a consequence is in line with other evidence33 but further research is required to investigate the impact of disease status, comorbidity, multidrug therapy on prospective and long-term outcomes of clinical care. author affiliations 1department of medicine, university of calgary, calgary, alberta, canada 2arthritis research uk primary care centre, keele university, newcastle- under-lyme, staffordshire, uk 3health services research unit, keele university, newcastle-under-lyme, staffordshire, uk contributors err and dg coordinated the study data collection and contributed to the writing of the manuscript. er, dg and utk were involved in study design and developed the statistical approaches. utk conceived and designed the study, was involved with analysis, interpretation and contributed to the writing of this manuscript. all authors have contributed and approved the final version of this manuscript. funding this work was funded by a national institute for health research (nihr) in-practice fellowship for err and a nihr school for primary care research doctoral training studentship for djg. cipca and pipca databases were funded by the north staffordshire primary care research consortium and keele university institute for primary care and health sciences. this report presents independent research commissioned by the nihr. the views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the nhs, the nihr or the department of health. competing interests none. ethics approval north staffordshire ethics committee. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement no additional data are available. open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the creative commons attribution non commercial (cc by-nc 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non- commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ references 1. feinstein ar. the pre-therapeutic classification of co-morbidity in chronic disease. j chronic dis 1970;23:455–68. 2. van den akker m, buntinx f, et al. comorbidity or multimorbidity what’s in a name?
