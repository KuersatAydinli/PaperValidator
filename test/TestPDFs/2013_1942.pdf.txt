3    abstract:  background: the relevance of physical activity (pa) for combating cardiovascular disease  (cvd) risk in children has been highlighted, but there has not been any large-scale study  analysing that association in children aged <9 years of age. this study sought to evaluate the  associations between objectively- measured pa and clustered cvd risk factors in a large  sample of european children; and to provide evidence for gender-specific recommendations of  pa.  methods: cross-sectional data from a longitudinal study in 16,224 children aged 2 to 9 were  collected. of these, 3,120 (1016 between 2-6 years, 2104 between 6-9 years) had sufficient  data for inclusion in the current analyses. two different age- and gender-specific clustered  cvd risk scores associated with pa were determined. first, a cvd risk continuous score was  computed using the following variables: sbp, tg, tc/hdl-c ratio, homa-ir, and sum of  two skin-folds (score crfs). secondly, another cvd risk score was obtained for older  children containing the score crfs + the cardiorespiratory fitness variable (termed score  crfs+fit)  results: in boys <6 years, the odds ratios (or) for cvd risk were elevated in the least active  quintile of pa (or: 2.58) compared with the most active quintile as well as the second quintile  for vigorous pa (or: 2.91). compared with the most active quintile, older children in the 1st,  2nd, and 3rd quintiles had or for cvd risk score crfs+fit ranging from or 2.69 to 5.40 in  boys, and from or 2.85 to 7.05 in girls.   conclusions: pa is important to protect against clustering of cvd risk factors in young  children, being more consistent in those older than 6 years. health-care professionals should  recommend around 60 and 85 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous pa, including 20 min/day of  vigorous.

5    introduction  the risk for future cardiovascular disease (cvd) in apparently healthy children can be  assessed by a clustering of individual risk factors in the same individual as it describes a status  with several of these factors high simultaneously [1]. a risk factor understands as a key  parameter which can model the risk for cvd. obesity is one of the main risk factors  associated with increased cvd risk in children and adolescents [2]. precisely, conditions such  as overweight and obesity in children have, in recent years, reached epidemic proportions.  they are rapidly increasing, with marked effects at all socioeconomic levels and ethnicities [3- 5]. recently, several reviews have highlighted the relevance of physical activity (pa) as the  main therapeutic tool for combating cvd risk in children and adolescents [6-8]. the use of  objectively-measured pa as well as the use of clusters of metabolic risk have been suggested  as being appropriate for more precise analysis of these relationships [6]. several studies have  shown an inverse relationship between objective pa and metabolic syndrome risk factors in  healthy children and adolescents [9-16]. most of the studies analysing the association between  pa and cvd risk are based on children from the different parts of the european youth heart  study with children of 9 and 15 years of age [9, 10, 12-14, 16]. all these studies observed an  inverse relationship. recently, this inverse association has also been observed in a relatively  small study (n=223) performed with swedish children aged 8 -11 years [15]. only one cross  sectional study addressed these relationships in children aged <9 years, especially in younger  children (<6 years) [11]. butte et al. studied a sample of 897 hispanic children (4-19 years) in  the usa and they observed no association of pa with the presence of cvd risk, but a  significant association was found with the number of components included in the concept of  metabolic syndrome  (from 0 to 5 components such as high waist circumference, lower high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), higher levels of hypertriglyceridaemia, high blood  pressure, and fasting glucose) [11]. finally, the group of andersen et al. failed to found any 


6    association at age of 6 years (n=435), although conclude that clustering of cvd risk factors  developed between the age of six and nine years [1, 17].  to the best of our knowledge, there  has not been any study analysing the association of objectively-measured pa in relation to  clustered cvd risk factors focussing on children aged from 2 to 9 years, with gender-specific  information in a relatively large sample.  since 2000, there have been several pa recommendations with respect to duration and  intensity required to ensure healthy lifestyle in children and adolescents (age range: 6-17  years) [9, 18-23] and movement coordination benefits in younger children (age range: 2-5  years) [24]. the consensus recommendation has been that children and adolescents should  participate in ≥60 min of pa of moderate-vigorous intensity daily (or most days of the week)  [18-23]. later, in 2006, andersen et al. recommended daily pa of 90 min duration based on  their findings in children aged 9 and 15 years [9]. conversely, wittmeier et al. suggested 60  min per day instead of 90 min in children aged 8-11 years as an attainable goal in view of the  lower percentage of those achieving higher intensity activity in their study [18]. finally, in  2007 a recommendation of 60 min of pa was made for young children (2-5 years) based on  evidence of benefits accruing with respect to cognitive performance and motor skills.  however, there was not enough evidence to suggest metabolic improvement [24]. hence, more  specific recommendations on pa (levels and intensities) for health benefits are needed,  especially in relation to age groups (including those <6 years) and/or gender.   the objectives of the present study were: 1) to evaluate the associations between objectively- measured pa intensities and clustered cvd risk factors in a large sample of european children  aged 2 to 9 years; 2) to provide evidence for the development of gender-specific  recommendations of pa for this young population.      


7    methods  study population  data used in the current analysis were derived from the idefics (identification and  prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) study. a  total of 16,224 children aged 2 to 9 years were recruited during the baseline survey, which was  conducted between 2007 and 2008 in eight european countries (italy, estonia, cyprus,  belgium, sweden, germany, hungary, spain) [25]. all participants met the general idefics  inclusion criteria: age group 2 to 9 years; available data on body mass and height; completion  of the parental questionnaire. from the total sample of 16,224 children, a subset of 12,134 had  valid data for age, body mass, height, body mass index (bmi) and blood sample parameters.  as accelerometry was measured only in a subset from every centre due to the accelerometers  availability, when the objectively measurement of pa was included in the analyses the sample  size was reduced. for the purpose of the current analyses, only subjects (n = 3,019) with a  complete set of data that included total triglycerides (tg), total cholesterol (tc), hdl-c,  glucose, insulin, systolic blood pressure (sbp), sum of two skin-fold thickness measurements,  exposure (pa intensities) and confounding variables were included. when the score. no  differences with respect to mean age, body mass and z-score bmi were observed between  individuals in this subset with complete data and the rest of the sample. the study protocol  was approved by the ethics committee at each study centre following the ethical guidelines of  the declaration of helsinki 1964 (revision of edinburgh 2000), the good clinical practice, and  the legislation about clinical research in humans. written informed consent was obtained from  the parents (or guardian) of each child participating in the study.  measurements  for the quality management, all measurements followed detailed standard operation  procedures that were laid down in the general survey manual and finalised after the pretest of 


8    all survey modules [26]. field personnel from each study centre participated in the central  training and organised local training sessions thereafter. the co-ordinating centre conducted  site visits to each study location during both field surveys to check adherence of field [25].  socioeconomic status (ses)  ses was estimated using the international standard classification of education. a score was  calculated from the highest education and qualification levels of both parents. five groups  were defined using a scale from 0 to 6: level 1 (0-1), level 2 (2), level 3 (3), level 4 (4), and  level 5 (5-6), the lower score the lower ses.  physical examinations  body mass was measured in light clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg with an electronic scale  (tanita bc 420 sma, tokyo, japan). height was measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1  cm using a stadiometer (seca 225 gmbh & kg, germany). skin-fold thicknesses were  measured with a holtain calliper (holtain ltd., croswell, uk) at the triceps and subscapular  sites. blood pressure was measured with an electronic sphygmomanometer (welch allyn  4200b-e2) [27] preferably in the right arm with the child seated and in a calm environment.  two measurements were taken at two-minute intervals and, if they differed by >5%, a third  measurement was taken. the mean of the two (or three) measurements was used in all  statistical analyses.  physical activity  the uniaxial actigraph accelerometer (actigraph mti, model gt1m, manufacturing  technology inc., fort walton beach, fl, usa) and the actitrainer (www.actitrainer.com)  were used to measure pa. the actitrainer technology is based on the actigraph  accelerometer with additional functions (heart rate). the rationale to use actigraph in  younger and actitrainer in older children was to record, when possible, the heart rate.  however, in the current study only data from accelerometers were used and cross-validation 


9    was not necessary as both accelerometers have the same model of actigraph. prior to data  collection, parents were instructed in the correct positioning of the accelerometer, it is, to  attach the accelerometer to the right hip of the child during their waking day by means of an  elastic belt and adjusted to ensure close contact with the body. the accelerometer needed to  be worn all day over 4-5 days, except during water-based activities and during sleep.  recordings were for least 6h/day for at least 3 days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the weekend or  holiday) according with the results of the reliability analysis indicating a minimum duration  of 6 h per day of monitoring  to achieve 80% reliability [28]. the sampling interval (epoch)  was set at 15 seconds. non-wear time was excluded from the data my means of an automated  method which use an algorithm developed using r (version r 2.9.0., r foundation for  statistical computing, vienna, austria; http://www.r-project.org). thus,  periods of 20 min  or more consecutive zero counts were replaced by missing data code before further analysis  [28]. a measure of average total volume of activity (hereafter called total pa) was expressed  as the sum of recorded counts divided by total daily registered time expressed in minutes  (counts/min; cpm). the cut-offs to define the pa intensity categories were derived from  previously-validated cut-offs [29], with time spent in light pa (min) defined as the sum of  time-per-day in which counts per epoch were 26-573 cpm. the time engaged in moderate pa  was calculated based upon a cut-off of 574-1002 cpm per epoch. the time engaged in  vigorous pa was calculated based upon a cut-off of ≥1003 cpm per epoch. also, the time  spent in “effective” intensity level was calculated as the sum of time spent in moderate +  vigorous pa (mvpa).  cardiorespiratory fitness  fitness was measured by the progressive 20-m shuttle run test [30]. this test required subjects  to run back and forth between two lines set 20 meters apart at a pace determined by audio 


10    signals. the initial speed was set at 8.5 km•h-1 increasing by 0.5 km•h-1 every minute (1  minute equals 1 stage). the test was completed when the child failed to reach the end lines in  time with the audio signals on two consecutive occasions. the final score was computed as the  number of stages completed (precision of 0.5 stages). stages completed were used to estimate  the vo2max [30].  biological samples  a detailed description of the blood sampling procedures has been published elsewhere [31].  briefly, blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast and previous confirmation by  questionnaire of achievement this criterion. blood glucose, tc, hdl-c and tg were assessed  on site at each study centre by point-of-care analysis using the cholestech ldx analyser  (cholestech, hayward, ca, usa) [32]. serum insulin concentrations were determined by  luminescence immunoassay in a central laboratory using an auto-ga immu 2000. to derive  a measure of insulin resistance we used the homeostasis model assessment (homa-ir) [33]  using fasting glucose and plasma insulin according to the following formula:   homa-ir = [fasting insulin (pmol/l)/6.945]×[fasting glucose (mmol/l)/22.5]   cardiovascular risk score  according to andersen et al. [9] a continuous score clustering cvd risk factors was computed  using the following variables: sbp, tg, tc/hdl-c ratio, homa-ir, and sum of two skin- folds (score crfs). since the 20-m shuttle run test was only performed in children >6 years of  age, a second cvd risk score was obtained for older children containing the score crfs + the  cardiorespiratory fitness variable using the total number of stages (termed score crfs+fit). z- scores were calculated for each risk factor variable by age and gender, followed by a summing  of individual z-scores to create the two clustered risk scores. cardiorespiratory fitness z-score  was multiplied by -1 to indicate higher metabolic risk with increasing value. the lower the  cvd risk the better the overall cvd risk factor profile. 


11    statistical analysis  predictive analytics software (pasw, version 18; spss inc., chicago, il, usa) was used  to perform the analyses. statistical significance was set at p<0.05. the data are presented as  mean ± standard deviation (sd) unless otherwise stated. mean and sd for cvd risk were  calculated for age and gender groupings of the children who had a complete set of  measurements. age groups were recorded as younger children (between 2 - 6 years) and  older children (between 6 - 9 years). the distributions of pa were observed to be skewed and  so to achieve normality of distributions, moderate pa, vigorous pa, and mvpa were  transformed to the natural logarithm values. individuals >1 sd away from the mean in the  clustered risk scores were defined as being “at risk”. for descriptive variables, the student's t- test was used to test the differences between genders. to examine the association between  pa intensities and cvd risk scores, partial correlation analyses adjusted for country were  conducted in both age groups.  age and gender-specific quintiles were created for each pa intensity. one-way analysis of  covariance (ancova) was used to test the differences in cvd risk scores (dependent  variables) among quintiles of pa (fixed factor) segregated by age and gender and adjusted for  country (dummy variable) and ses.  logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (or) for having clustered  risk score (dichotomous variable; z score above 1sd) across quintiles of different pa  intensities (quintile 5 as reference) segregated by age and gender. country (dummy variable)  and ses were included as covariates.  moreover, descriptive analyses were performed to stand  out the mean, sd and range of time corresponding at each quintile among the different pa  intensities segregated by age and gender. finally, the mean, sd and range at the highest  quintile (q5) of pa was selected as potential recommendation.   


12    results   descriptive characteristic of the study sample  table 1 summarises the descriptive characteristics of the study sample. in younger children,  girls had significantly higher sum of two skin-folds, insulin and homa-ir values than boys  (all p<0.001), while the boys had higher weight, height, glucose, hdl-c and all pa  intensities (except vigorous pa) than girls (all p<0.05). age, bmi, sbp, diastolic blood  pressure (dbp), tc, tg, vigorous pa and cvd risk score crfs mean values were similar  between genders. in older children, girls had significantly higher sum of two skin-folds,  insulin, homa-ir, tc and tg values than boys (all p<0.01), while boys had greater height,  sbp, glucose, hdl-c, moderate, vigorous, mvpa and total pa as well as cardiorespiratory  fitness than their female counterparts (all p<0.05). the means of age, weight, bmi and cvd  risk scores (crfs and crfs+fit) were similar in both genders. when the bonferroni  correction factor for multiple tests was applied, only those with p < 0.0025 remained  significant.  correlations  partial correlations between pa intensities and cvd risk scores (crfs and crfs+fit) in  both age groups were performed following adjustment for country. in young children, only  vigorous pa was inversely correlated with the cvd risk score crfs (r: -0.086; p<0.01;  n=994). in older children, moderate pa, vigorous pa, mvpa and total pa intensities were  inversely correlated with both cvd risk scores (score crfs ranged from -0.089 to -0.166, all  p< 0.01, n=2025; score crfs+fit ranged from -0.111 to -0.251, all p<0.001, n=835).   differences in mean z score by quintiles of pa  vigorous pa intensity was the only pa variable that was associated with cvd risk score in  younger children. also, this was the strongest correlation with cvd risk scores in older 


13    children and, consequently, was used in subsequent analyses. total pa was also used as an  overall activity indicator. figures 1 and 2 depict mean z score in each quintile of pa  segregated by age and gender groups. in younger children, non-significant differences in  cvd risk score crfs through quintiles of vigorous (figure 1) and total pa (figure 2) were  observed. in older children, significantly lower values of cvd risk score crfs+fit through  quintiles of vigorous pa (figure 1) and total pa (figure 2) were observed in both genders  (all p<0.01). additional analyses using score a instead of score b showed similar results.  additional sensitivity analyses using tertiles instead of quintiles or the pa cut-offs  of van  cauwenberghe e  et al. [34] were made, and the results did not change substantially.   likelihood for metabolic risk  the risks of having cvd risk score crfs (dichotomous z score >1sd) for pa intensities in  children from both age groups are summarised in table 2. in young boys, the or, compared  with the most active quintile, were raised in the least active quintile of total pa 2.58 (95%ci:  1.07 to 6.18) and in the second quintile for vigorous pa (or: 2.91; 95%ci: 1.25 to 6.82). in  older children, the risk of having cvd risk score crfs decreased with increased activity for  all pa intensities. or for the least active quintiles compared to the most active quintiles of  the different pa intensities ranged from 2.69 to 3.82 and 2.32 to 2.95 in boys and girls,  respectively (table 2). when the cvd risk score was calculated used bmi instead of the sum  of two skin-fold thickness measurements, the results did not change substantially. when  sensitivity analyses using tertiles instead of quintiles or other pa cut-offs [34] were used, the  results did not change substantially.  since cardiorespiratory fitness data were only available for older children, the logistic  regression analyses were repeated for the cvd score crfs+fit including the reciprocal of  the cardiorespiratory fitness scores. the results for both genders are summarised in table 3.  likelihood ratios for score crfs+fit were higher than for score crfs. children in the 1st, 


14    2nd and 3rd quintiles had or for cvd risk score ranging from 2.69 to 5.40 in boys and from  2.85 to 7.05 in girls, relative to the most active quintile. sensitivity analyses did not change  the results substantially. table 4 summarises the time-per-day spent at the different pa  intensities in the 5 quintiles of pa, and the cpm of total pa.                                


15    discussion  the main findings of the study were the inverse associations between pa and clustered cvd  risk factor scores. the risk was raised in the 1st to 3rd quintiles of pa for older children  compared to the most active quintile, while in younger children some inverse association  were found only for boys, but not sufficiently consistent. the time spent at mvpa in the 5th  quintile was a mean of 85 min and 66 min in older children (boys and girls, respectively),  thereupon, the current recommendation for pa of at least 60 min/day of at least moderate  intensity in order to avoid the negative consequences of clustering of risk factors could be  appropriate for girls but might be a slight underestimate for boys.   comparison with other studies  our findings concur with others that had observed inverse associations between pa and cvd  risk factors [9-16]. however, most of these studies had been conducted in children at the age  of 9 and 15 years. our study observed this inverse relationship between objectively-measured  pa and cvd risk score in children aged 2 to 9 years who constitute a less well investigated  age range, establishing that there is only consistent evidence for children aged 6 to 9 years. in  addition, our results provided more relevant gender-specific data on the strength of  association and the pa intensities. moreover, butte et al. performed the only study with  children aged of 4 to 19 years, but failed to show a clear association between pa and cvd  risk factors [11]. in a first approach the correlations were significant although small variances  were explained, which could be partially due to the overall low pa levels found in this  sample. despite that, in the present study an inverse relationship between pa and cvd risk  score was found consistently in older boys and girls (6 to 9 years). the weaker associations  observed exclusively in younger boys may be due to these cvd risk factors not being  manifest, as yet, in this age group of particularly young children (2 to 6 years) accordingly 


16    with other authors whose failed to found any association in younger children (6 years old) [1,  17]. moreover, the relatively healthy sample from this study, as well as, the impossibility to  use the score including cardiorespiratory fitness as suggested being adequate could hamper  the sensitivity in detecting associations [35]. however, more studies should look at this age  range in order to corroborate that assumption. non-concordance between studies could be  due to methodological differences such as sample size (lower in others vs. current study),  ethnic origin, age range, and stratification of the data for analysis.  the present study focused on children aged 2 to 9 years. they are younger than those studies  on which previous recommendations had been based (6 to 17 years) [9, 18-23]. since the  consensus is that pa requirements should be age-specific [7], our data analyses were  performed in 2 age groups: 2-6 and 6-9 years of age. this enables, for the first time, separate  recommendations to be formulated for children <6 years of age, and for those who are older.  nevertheless, the lack of consistency in the younger group make necessary to be caution  when interpreting the levels of pa in younger children as it should not be used for  recommendation, but only for description. our study observed that, in girls from the older  age group, the current recommendation [23] of pa of at least 60 min/day of at least moderate  intensity could be enough to prevent the negative consequences of cvd risk factor scores.  however, in boys from the same age group, 85 min (rather than 60 min) could be a more  appropriate threshold to ensure a lower cvd risk factor score and close to the 90 min daily  pa suggested by andersen et al. [9].  further, an important finding of note in our study is that  the mean time spent at vigorous pa in older children should be around 20 min/day. our  findings regarding time spent at vigorous pa in order to pre-empt potential cvd risk are in  agreement with other studies which observed that a similar amount of vigorous pa can  discriminate between normal weight and overweight [36] while being associated with better 


17    bone mineral content [37]. to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study that analysed  the association between objectively-measured pa and clustered cvd risk factors in a large  sample of children from 2 to 9 years, as well as providing gender-specific recommendation  for children aged 6 to 9 years.  strength and limitations  strengths of the present study are the availability of standardised measures of objective pa,  insulin resistance and other cvd risk factors, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness. further,  having a well balanced gender distribution within a large heterogeneous sample of young  children from eight european countries provides an excellent opportunity to derive gender- specific data. to date, studies regarding the association between pa and cvd risk factors (as  well as the current guidelines for pa) are focused mainly on older children. our study,  instead, covers ages from 2 to 9 years. these aspects are of interest for public health since  they provide new insights into pa needs and recommendations for younger children that may  used by physicians and other health-care workers.   the present study has several limitations. the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes  determining any causality in the findings. the overall healthy sample, with only 15% of  children above 1sd of the cvd score, could limit the interpretation of the present result,  particularly in a less healthy population. only interventional studies with exercise could  establish whether or not these specific recommendations are effective in reducing  cardiovascular risk and our findings have not established the efficacy of these  recommendations. more randomized controlled trials and prospective studies are needed to  focus on improving cvd risk factor status through increasing the volume and intensity of pa  and differencing by age range. 


18    conclusion  pa is important to prevent clustering of risk factors in young children aged 6 to 9 years. in  clinical settings, practitioners should recommend that, in girls, the current guidelines of at  least 60 min/day of pa of at least moderate intensity could be enough, but around 20 of these  minutes should be at vigorous intensity. however in boys, 85 min/day mvpa including  around 20 min vigorous pa could be necessary to prevent the negative consequences  ascribed to clustering of risk factors. in younger children aged 2 to 6 years it seems that this  role of pa is less consistent than in older children based on the low numbers of significant  associations, although indication of some influence of pa as preventive tool are observed in  such young children. to assess how changes in pa volume and intensity can causally affect  clustering of cvd risk factors in young children remains to be properly explored. future  interventions are needed to identify how much increase in pa intensity and volume would be  required to improve cvd risk factor status.
