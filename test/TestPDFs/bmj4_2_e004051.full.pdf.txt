after surgery for ui, and among women using antibiotics for uti before surgery to estimate the risk of post- operative use in a short-term and long-term perspective. this topic is clinically highly relevant in the counselling of women prior to surgery for ui: what can they expect of postoperative complications? can preoperative drug users expect to continue drug use after surgery? materials and methods study population and settings women were included in the study if they had a primary surgical procedure for ui within the period of 1 january 1996 through 31 december 2010. data on performed procedures were retrieved from the danish national patient registry (npr)18 according to codes listed in online supplementary appendix 1. the surgical proce- dures were performed in one of four hospitals in the county of funen, denmark, between 1 january 1996 and 31 december 2006 or for the period 2007 through 2010 in 1 of 13 hospitals in the new region of southern denmark (including funen). the extension of the area was due to a change in the organisation of the health- care system in 2007, including a structural change from 14 counties to 5 regions. women with concomitant or prior surgery for pelvic organ prolapse were included. women younger than 18 years were excluded. data sources data for this study were retrieved from three danish regis- ters: the npr, odense university pharmacoepidemiologic database (oped), the statistics denmark. all danish citi- zens are assigned a unique civil registration number (crn), which enables individual-level linkage across registries.19 the npr contains data on discharges from public hos- pitals in denmark, and the completeness of recordings has been estimated to be 99.4%.20 information available in the registry pertain to the crn, the dates of admis- sion, dates of discharge and discharge diagnoses, classi- ﬁed according to the international classiﬁcation of diseases-8 (icd-8) (1977–1993) and icd-10 (1994 and onward)21 22 as well as codes from the danish classiﬁca- tion system of surgical procedures.23 information on relevant drugs (antibiotics and oestro- gens) was retrieved from the oped for the period 1995 to 2011 for the entire study population. the oped is pharmacy-based and captures all reim- bursed prescriptions, and contains person-identiﬁable data with complete coverage on all computerised pre- scription reimbursements from the county of funen (population 2006: 479 000) from 1990 and from january 2007 onwards extended to the whole region of southern denmark (population 1.2 million). the age and gender distribution of this population are very similar to that of the danish population as a whole (2006: 5.4 million), and the prescribing of drugs is very similar to the national average.24 prescription reimbursements are given independent of patient income to all legal inhabitants of denmark as a part of the national health service. each record includes the crn, date of purchase, a full account of what have been dispensed, including the brand name and the anatomical therapeutic chemical (atc) classi- ﬁcation code. information not included in the prescrip- tion database is drugs sold over the counter or drugs not reimbursed by the county authority (mainly oral contra- ceptives, sedatives and hypnotics). data on highest attained educational level and annual income were retrieved from the danish integrated database for labour market research at statistics denmark, a data- base with annually updated socioeconomic data for each danish citizen, mainly supplied by tax authorities, edu- cational institutions and employment services.25 antibiotics under study included drugs were antibiotics traditionally used in denmark exclusively or predominantly for the treatment of uti (sulphamethizole (atc j01eb02), pivmecillinam (atc j01ca08), nitrofurantoin (atc j01xe01), tri- methoprim (atc j01ea01), as well as mecillinam (atc j01ca11))26 27 and with a duration of 3–5 days. the indications for the prescribed drugs are not registered in the oped; therefore, pivampicillin and amoxicillin were not included—as these antibiotics are also com- monly used in treatment of upper respiratory tract infec- tions. likewise, broader spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins and quinolones were not included, as they are not commonly used for utis in denmark. exposed and unexposed cohorts exposed cohort: all women ≥18 years undergoing a primary surgical procedure for ui between 1 january 1996 and 31 december 2010 in the county of funen/ region of southern denmark, and having redeemed one or more prescriptions on antibiotics within 365 days preceding the date of surgery (index date). unexposed cohort: all women ≥18 years undergoing a primary surgical procedure for ui between 1 january 1996 and 31 december 2010 in the county of funen/ region of southern denmark without having redeemed similar prescriptions within the same time frame. outcome data for both exposed and unexposed women, the outcome was use of antibiotics for uti, deﬁned as having redeemed at least one prescription for these antibiotics within (1) 60 days after the index date (short-term post- operative users) and (2) 61–365 days after the index date (long-term postoperative users). these outcomes were not mutually exclusive, that is, a woman might be classiﬁed as a short-term and long-term user, postoperatively. 2 guldberg r, kesmodel us, brostrøm s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004051. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004051 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


covariates the use of antibiotics might be affected by age, type of surgery, use of oestrogen, comorbidity, calendar time and the individuals’ ability to pay for the medicine might be affected by educational level and annual income. therefore, these variables were included in the analysis as potential confounders. type of procedures the types of ui surgery were divided into four groups according to the surgical procedure code: (1) mid- urethral sling procedures with transobturator route (tomus), (2) mid-urethral sling procedures with retro- pubic route (rpmus), (3) bulking procedures and (4) other types of ui surgeries. oestrogen use of oestrogens (atc g03c) was included in the ana- lyses as a confounder. to adjust for preoperative oestrogen use, preoperative users of oestrogens were deﬁned as women who had redeemed at least one prescription for oestrogens within 365 days preceding the date of surgery and nonusers were deﬁned as those who had no preoperative oestro- gen use during the same period. the local and systemic oestrogens were included. comorbidity the comorbidity was classiﬁed according to the vali- dated, well-known and widely used charlson comorbidity index (cci),28–31 which assigns different weights (1, 2, 3 and 6) to 20 different disease categories speciﬁed by medical condition and severity (eg, diabetes, cardiovascu- lar diseases, chronic pulmonary, renal, liver and connect- ive tissue diseases). the cci was computed based on each woman’s complete hospital discharge history from the npr since 1977. a categorised version of the cci score values was used: 0 (low), 1–2 (medium) and 3+ (high).32 education and income information on educational level and annual income for each woman was retrieved as a measure of socio- economic status. educational level was categorised according to the highest attained educational level in the year of surgery: ‘basic’ (basic school/high school educa- tion: 7–12 years of primary, secondary and grammar school education), ‘secondary’ (vocational education, 10–12 years of education) and ‘higher’ (a university degree or an examination in another higher institution requiring an average total of 13 years or more).28 on the basis of quartiles of annual income for each woman in the year of her surgery, we categorised women in low (1st quartile), medium (2nd and 3rd quartile) and high income (4th quartile). statistical analysis the use of antibiotics for uti within the ﬁrst 365 days after surgery for exposed and unexposed cohorts was illustrated in a ﬂow chart. we also constructed contin- gency tables for the main study variables, and computed ors, with 95% cis. to analyse the signiﬁcance of preoperative antibiotic use as risk factor of postoperative use (within 60 days and within 61–365 days after surgery), adjusted ors were estimated by means of multivariate logistic regres- sion models. adjustment was made for age (18–39, 40–59 and ≥60 years (reference)), type of procedures (tomus (ref- erence), rpmus, bulking, others), education (basic (ref- erence), secondary, higher), annual income (low (reference), middle, high), comorbidity (cci 0 (refer- ence), cci 1–2, cci 3+), calendar year (1996–2006, 2007–2008 (reference), 2009–2010) and use of oestro- gen within 365 days preceding the date of surgery (no (reference), yes). stratiﬁed analyses were performed according to the use of oestrogens before surgery to examine the associ- ation between the use of antibiotics for uti in oestrogen users versus oestrogen non-users. all analyses were performed using stata release v.12.0. results a total of 2151 women had a primary surgical procedure for ui between 1 january 1996 and 31 december 2010; 2073 had a solitary ui surgery, and 78 had concomitant surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. of the 2151 women, 1655 (76.9%) women did not use antibiotics for uti within 365 days preceding the date of surgery, while 496 (23.1%) did, and the majority (376/ 496=75.8%) redeemed ≤2 prescriptions preoperatively and only a minority (42/496=8%) redeemed more than ﬁve or more prescriptions. the use of antibiotics for uti within 365 days after surgery is detailed for the exposed and unexposed cohorts in ﬁgure 1. the most commonly used antibiotics both preoperatively and post- operatively were sulphamethizol and pivmecillinam. women having redeemed prescriptions for antibiotics for uti before surgery (exposed) of the 496 women with prior use of antibiotics for uti, 129 (26%) redeemed a prescription for antibiotics for uti within 0–60 days after surgery, and of these, 85 (65.9%) also within 61–365 days after surgery (ﬁgure 1). a total of 215 (43.3%) continued to redeem prescrip- tions for antibiotics within 61–365 days (ﬁgure 1). women with no usage of antibiotics for uti before surgery (unexposed) of the 1655 women who did not redeem prescription before surgery, 182 (11%) women had a short-term use of antibiotics for uti after surgery; and of these, 64 women were also long-term users (ﬁgure 1). among unexposed without short-term postoperative use of anti- biotics, 171 (10.3%) became long-term postoperative guldberg r, kesmodel us, brostrøm s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004051. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004051 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


users (ﬁgure 1). the total number of women with long- term antibiotic use was 235 (14.2%). comparison of exposed and unexposed cohorts baseline characteristics of exposed and unexposed women are presented in table 1. the most commonly used procedure was to mus accounting for approxi- mately half of the procedures performed in both the exposed and the unexposed group. the most commonly prescribed drugs prior to surgery were sulphamethizol and pivmecillinam. compared with unexposed women, exposed women tended to be older, to be more frequent oestrogen users and to have higher comorbidity indices. there was no difference in educational level or personal annual income. the unadjusted or of a prior antibiotic user being a postoperative short-term and long-term user was 2.8 (95% ci 2.2 to 3.7) and 4.6 (95% ci 3.7 to 5.8), respect- ively. the adjusted or of being short-term and long- term user of antibiotics for uti after surgery was 2.6 (95% ci 2.0 to 3.5) and 4.5 (95% ci 3.5 to 5.7), respect- ively (table 2). thus, adjustment for confounders did vir- tually not change the relative risk estimates. the details from logistic regression models are presented in table 2 showing the impact of each prognostic factor included. regarding short-term use, the strongest risk factors were procedure types (rpmus/others), high comorbidity index and preoperative antibiotic use. preoperative use of antibiotics for uti was the strongest risk factor of long-term postoperative use. stratiﬁed analyses according to the use of oestrogens before surgery showed that among users of oestrogen, the adjusted or for short-term and long-term use of antibiotics for uti after surgery increased to 3.3 (95% ci 2.3 to 4.8) and 5.2 (95% ci 3.7 to 7.3), respectively, table 3. discussion among 2151 women undergoing surgery for ui, nearly one-fourth had redeemed at least one prescription of antibiotics for uti preoperatively, and among preopera- tive users nearly half of the women also redeemed pre- scriptions of antibiotics for uti within 61–365 days after surgery. among preoperative users of antibiotics we found a 2–3-fold increased risk of short-term use of anti- biotics for uti after surgery, and a 4–5-fold increased risk of being long-term user. in women not using anti- biotics for uti before surgery only a minor proportion initiated use of antibiotics after surgery. to ensure that our results were not inﬂuenced by effect modiﬁcation of oestrogen use we stratiﬁed our analyses for preoperative use of oestrogen. in both strata we found an increased risk of postoperative antibiotic use for the exposed women. the risk estimates for short- term and long-term use were, however, higher among women using oestrogen preoperatively compared with women without prior oestrogen use. the proportion of women with concomitant surgery for pelvic organ prolapse in our cohort of women with ui surgery was low, and this was as expected given the current practice in scandinavia with a conservative approach of addressing the predominant problem of either pelvic organ prolapse or ui in sequential surgery.33 thus, our results were not inﬂuenced by a mixed cohort with both ui surgery and pelvic organ prolapse surgery. our study has several strengths: (1) it is population- based in the sense that this study covers all the relevant surgeries in a well-deﬁned geographic area in denmark, (2) the source of procedure codes in the npr has high coverage and validity—the npr records 99.4% of all dis- charges from hospitals in denmark, and the procedures in the nrp have been validated showing a high quality of the data with positive predictive values of 94–100%,34–36 figure 1 women (n=2151) with primary surgery for urinary incontinence (ui) and their use of antibiotics for urinary tract infection before and after surgery for ui. exposed women had redeemed one or more prescriptions of antibiotics within 365 days preceding the date of surgery. unexposed women had not redeemed prescriptions of antibiotics within 365 days preceding the date of surgery. 4 guldberg r, kesmodel us, brostrøm s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004051. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004051 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


(3) the access to high-quality data on prescriptions from the oped that are representative for the danish population,24 (4) information on several confounders such as comorbidity and socioeconomic status, (5) com- plete information on the follow-up period for all included women, (6) outcome data on postoperative antibiotic prescriptions are recorded independently of prior antibiotic use, thus preventing differential mis- classiﬁcation of the outcome, (7) the antibiotics included in this study are uti speciﬁc and are drugs of choice in denmark for treating uti and ﬁnally (8) the surgical procedures included have no other indications than ui, which strongly limits the number of alternative interpretations of our ﬁndings. furthermore, the exclu- sion of antibiotics with other indications than uti may even have led to an underestimation of the risk of uti. there are possible limitations to our study. we have no information on perioperative use of antibiotic, anti- biotic given while the patient was still hospitalised, or results of urine culture. a redeemed prescription of anti- biotics for uti does not necessarily equal a uti, and urine culture is not always performed prior to a prescrip- tion. thus, empiric therapy is possible. to prevent uti and other postoperative infections a perioperative single- dose of intravenous antibiotic is often used in denmark.37 however, perioperative antibiotic use is unlikely to be much different between exposed and unexposed cohorts and will thus not bias our relative risk estimates. in the short-term perspective after surgery we had no knowledge of postoperative catheter usage which is a limitation, especially since postoperative uti is associated with catheter usage in the postoperative period,38 39 but again we have no reasons to believe that use of catheters differed among exposed and unexposed cohorts. we were not able to control for all potential confounders such as body mass index, parity, intraopera- tive bladder perforation or precise menopausal status, but the importance of these factors for the association examined in this study is not clear. we had no data on patient symptomatology, that is, whether stress ui, urgency ui, mixed ui or overactive bladder syndrome were predominant, or on urodynamic study, and it could have been interesting to further examine the users of uti antibiotics (both before and after surgery) accord- ing to the type of ui symptomatology. it is surprising that among women using antibiotics for utis before ui surgery, half of them have a continu- ing tendency to use these antibiotics after surgery. this is not explained by recurrent ui surgery in the study period of 1 year after surgery as only approximately 5% of women experienced a new surgery in our population. possible explanations for the continuing tendency to uti could be a genetic predisposition for uti, an ana- tomic predisposition for uti, or an increased awareness of uti for both the women and their doctor. on the basis of the ﬂow chart in our study, we observed a tendency to continuing uti among women with preoperative antibiotic use in short-term and long- term, postoperatively. to our knowledge, this is the largest, and only population-based, study examining the use of antibiotics for uti in relation to surgery for ui and addressing the risk of short-term and long-term postoperative use of antibiotics for uti among women with preoperative uti. in addition, our study provides knowledge about which other factors than preoperative table 1 baseline

antibiotic were important for postoperative antibiotic use for uti. we found that for short-term use procedure type (rpmus, others), and high comorbidity were risk factors and for long-term use high comorbidity was a risk factor. our study also showed that educational level and personal income did not seem to inﬂuence the risk of postoperative antibiotic use. in denmark, dipstick urine test is a part of the preopera- tive examination, and surgeons might feel encouraged to treat the women with antibiotics prior to surgery based on dipstick urine test without symptoms or urine culture in an attempt to try to minimise the risk of postoperative uti. according to the danish programme for the surveil- lance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance in bacteria from animals, food and humans, the resistance, especially in bacteria other than escherichia coli, has increased during the last years. e coli is the most fre- quent cause of utis both in community-acquired and hospital-acquired utis. our study calls for further studies within this area— studies examining uti before and after surgery accord- ing to different types of ui (stress ui, urgency ui, mixed ui), uti in relation to surgery in especially post- menopausal women, issues regarding recurrent uti and ui surgery, and if prophylactic antibiotic use (periopera- tive intravenous/prolonged oral antibiotics) could reduce the risk of postoperative uti after ui surgery in a short-term and long-term perspective. furthermore, it would be interesting to assess the use of similar antibio- tics in the background population of women to examine whether there is an increased antibiotic burden asso- ciated with surgery for ui. in conclusion, we found that one in four women undergoing surgery for ui was treated for uti before surgery, and half of these women continued the ten- dency of uti after surgery. in women not using antibio- tics for uti before surgery only a minor proportion initiated use of antibiotics for uti after surgery. the table 2 risk factors of postoperative use of antibiotics postoperative non-use postoperative short-term use postoperative non-use postoperative long-term use number number or (95% ci) number number or (95% ci) preoperative use no 1473 182 reference 1420 235 reference yes 367 129 2.6 (2.0 to 3.5) 281 215 4.5 (3.5 to 5.7) age group 18–39 185 27 0.9 (0.5 to 1.5) 163 49 1.5 (0.9 to 2.3) 40–59 981 126 0.6 (0.5 to 0.9) 931 176 0.7 (0.5 to 0.9) 60− 674 158 reference 607 225 reference procedure rpmus 568 107 1.7 (1.1 to 2.7) 529 146 1.3 (0.9 to 1.9) tomus 849 123 reference 782 190 reference bulking 315 45 1.4 (0.9 to 2.0) 278 82 1.1 (0.8 to 1.5) others 108 36 3.1 (1.6 to 5.9) 112 32 1.5 (0.8 to 2.8) preoperative use of oestrogen* no 1059 149 reference 992 216 reference yes 781 162 1.2 (0.9 to 1.6) 709 234 1.2 (0.9 to 1.5) comorbidity (cci) 0 1328 184 reference 1241 271 reference 1–2 425 95 1.5 (1.1 to 2.0) 384 136 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8) 3+ 87 32 3.1 (1.6 to 5.9) 76 43 1.5 (1.0 to 2.4) educational level† basic 775 142 reference 702 215 reference secondary 665 105 1.1 (0.8 to 1.5) 623 147 1.0 (0.7 to 1.1) higher 362 62 1.3 (0.9 to 2.0) 342 82 0.9 (0.6 to 1.3) annual income low 434 103 reference 404 133 reference middle 930 147 0.9 (0.6 to 1.2) 847 230 1.0 (0.8 to 1.3) high 476 61 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) 450 87 0.9 (0.6 to 1.3) year of surgery 1996–2006 363 96 1.4 (0.9 to 2.2) 352 107 0.9 (0.7 to 1.1) 2007–2008 692 99 reference 628 163 reference 2009–2010 785 116 1.0 (0.8 to 1.4) 721 180 1.0 (0.8 to 1.4) results from multivariate logistic regression models on (1) short-term (0–60 days after surgery) and (2) long-term (61–356 days after surgery). *women with at least one redeemed prescription of oestrogen within 365 days preceding the date of surgery. †unknown highest attained educational level: 40 women. cci, charlson comorbidity index; post op, postoperative; rpmus, retropubic mid-urethral sling; tomus, trans-obturator mid-urethral sling. 6 guldberg r, kesmodel us, brostrøm s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004051. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004051 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from
