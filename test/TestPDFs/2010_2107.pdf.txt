  - 2 -  abstract  background  peripheral intravenous device (ivd) complications were traditionally thought to be reduced  by limiting dwell time. current recommendations are to resite ivds by 96 hours with the  exception of children and patients with poor veins. recent evidence suggests routine resite is  unnecessary, at least if devices are inserted by a specialised iv team. the aim of this study  was to compare the impact of peripheral ivd ‘routine resite’ with ‘removal on clinical  indication’ on ivd complications, in a general hospital without an iv team.    methods  a randomised controlled trial in a regional teaching hospital. after ethics approval, 362  patients (603 ivds) were randomised to have ivds replaced on clinical indication (185  patients) or routine change every 3 days (177 patients). ivds were inserted and managed by  the general hospital medical and nursing staff; there was no iv team. the primary endpoint  was a composite of ivd complications: phlebitis, infiltration, occlusion, accidental removal,  local infection, and device-related bloodstream infection.     results  ivd complication rates were 68 per 1,000 ivd days (clinically indicated) and 66 per 1,000  ivd days (routine replacement) (p=0.86, rr 1.03, 95%ci 0.74, 1.43). time to first  complication per patient did not differ between groups (km with log rank, p=0.53). there  were no local infections or ivd-related bloodstream infections in either group. iv therapy  duration did not differ between groups (p=0.22), but more (p=0.004) ivds were placed per  patient in the routine replacement (mean 1.8) than the clinical indication group (mean 1.5),  with significantly higher hospital costs per patient (p<0.001). 


  - 3 -    conclusions  resite on clinical indication would allow 1 in 2 patients to have a single cannula per course  of iv treatment, as opposed to 1 in 5 patients managed with routine resite; overall  complication rates appear similar. clinically indicated resite would achieve savings in  equipment, staff time and patient discomfort. there is growing evidence to support the  extended use of peripheral ivds with removal only on clinical indication.    registration number   australian new zealand clinical trials registry (anzctr) number  actrn12608000421336     


  - 4 -  background  peripheral intravenous device (ivd) insertion is the most commonly performed invasive  procedure in hospitalised patients, with an estimated 150 million peripheral intravenous  devices placed each year in north america alone [1]. ivds are vital for delivery of hydration,  medicines and nutrition but are not without complications. serious adverse outcomes are  fortunately rare, with ivd-related bloodstream infection reported in a recent meta-analysis of  110 studies to occur in 0.1% of devices and 0.5 per 1,000 device days [2]. ivd treatment is  more frequently interrupted by phlebitis, an irritation of the vein characterised by pain,  tenderness on palpation, erythema, warmth, swelling, induration or palpable cord  (thrombosis) of the cannulated vein; diagnostic algorithms usually require two or more of  these conditions [3-5]. phlebitis is in almost all cases a biochemical reaction to the  mechanical irritation by the presence of the ivd and associated infusate [3], although  phlebitis symptoms such as erythema may be misperceived as indicative of an infection. in  fact, there is not a high correlation between phlebitis and device infection, and the centers for  disease control (cdc) state that infection is rarely associated with peripheral, as opposed to  central, venous devices [3, 6, 7]. fluid infiltration or “tissuing” of devices is another common  ivd complication which may also reflect the inflammatory (phlebitic) response of the vein,  rather than simple misplacement of the device tip [8].    early cohort studies noted an association between increased device time in situ and phlebitis  [9, 10].  this association was responded to with policies for routine device removal.  recommended timelines for routine resite have been extended over the past three decades  from 24, to 48, then 72 hours. currently, 72-96 hour resite is recommended to reduce  phlebitis by the cdcs 2002 ‘guidelines for the prevention of intravascular device  infection”, with the exemption that this is not required in children or those with poor veins 


  - 5 -  [7]. such policies cause increased workload in hospitals, where the task of removing and  replacing well-functioning ivds generally falls to busy nursing and junior medical staff. in  addition, few patients welcome the prospect of additional venipuncture.    despite the general clinical acceptance of routine ivd replacement as a phlebitis and  infection prevention measure, it has not been supported by recent data. it may be that the  risk of complications during the entire ivd treatment episode is similar, regardless of  whether multiple short-dwell or fewer longer-dwell ivds are used, over this time. three  small (n=47-60) randomised controlled trials (rcts) suggested routine replacement at 12,  24 or 48 hours may reduce phlebitis compared to resite on clinical indication, although a  systematic review for the swedish council on technology assessment in healthcare  assessed these as low to medium quality studies providing ‘limited scientific evidence’  [11-14].  more recently, two well-conducted rcts found no evidence of effect when  comparing ivd replacement every 3 days with replacement only on clinical indication for  medical and surgical inpatients [15, 16]. the largest of these studies reported findings from  755 general medical and surgical patients with 1,428 ivds, and found a 5% difference in  combined phlebitis and infiltration rates per patient (38% clinically indicated resite,  33% routine resite), suggesting a potential small clinical benefit of 3 day resite [15].   however, this difference was not statistically significant (rr 1.15, 95%ci 0.95-1.40) and  disappeared when overall cannulation time was considered (59.8/1,000 ivd days  clinically indicated resite, 60.9/1,000 ivd days routine resite, rr 0.98, 95%ci 0.78-1.24)  [15]. in addition, no clinically important or statistically significant differences were  observed in the secondary endpoints of phlebitis, infiltration, occlusion, local infection or  suspected bloodstream infection rates between study groups [15]. another recent rct in the  ‘hospital in the home’ community setting also found no important clinical or statistically 


  - 6 -  significant difference in phlebitis, occlusion or bloodstream infections rates in 316 patients  when resite every 3 days was compared with clinically indicated resite [17]. a 2010  cochrane collaboration review concluded there was “no conclusive evidence of benefit”  of routine ivd resite and suggested organisations could consider adopting a resite on  clinical indication policy [18]. there is growing evidence that routine ivd replacement may  be ineffective, although caution has been urged in light of the large number (74% in both  groups in the largest study to date) of reported devices inserted by a specialised iv team, a  factor known to reduce complications [19].    device insertion (and reinsertion) is unpleasant for patients, requires skilled and available  clinical staff, and has associated costs for the health sector. if replacement only on clinical  indication is safe and effective, this would have important benefits for patients and the  health system. we report a randomised controlled trial of 3 day routine ivd resite versus  clinically indicated replacement in a medical-surgical hospital where ivds were inserted by  the general medical and nursing staff; the insitution did not have a specialised iv service.     methods  aim   the aim of the study was to compare the impact of 3 day routine resite, with clinically  indicated resite, on peripheral ivd complications    design  open (non-blinded), parallel group randomised controlled trial.    ethics 


  - 7 -  the study was approved by the tasmanian state human research ethics committee.  written informed consent was obtained prospectively from all participants.    setting and sample  the study was undertaken at a large regional teaching hospital in australia which functions  as the tertiary referral centre for the northern half of the state of tasmania. the hospital has  more than 32,000 separations per annum, with a spectrum of medical and surgical  specialties. eligible patients were at least 18 years of age; scheduled or expected to have a  peripheral ivd indwelling for at least 4 days, and gave written informed consent. exclusion  criteria were immunosuppression, current bloodstream infection or an ivd already in situ >  48 hours. ivds were inserted and cared for by the general nursing and medical staff; there  was no special iv team or service.    sample size  sample size calculations were calculated using pass 2008 (version 8.0.8, kaysville ut)  to detect a change in rates by 30% (from 36% to 25%, two-tailed α = 0.05, 90% power)  based on the complication rates of routinely resited ivs in a previous study [16]. although  this indicated that n= 378 per group (total 756) were required, the study was ceased early  (total n=606 ivs) due to all investigators leaving the employment of the institution.  consequently study power was reduced, but remained over 80% (required minimum n=282  per group).    recruitment  all adult patients admitted to the in-patient acute medical and surgical wards of the study  hospital were screened by a full-time research nurse. this excluded paediatric, day-surgery,  mental health, obstetric, critical care and dialysis units. 


  - 8 -    study procedures   patients were randomly assigned (computer generated) in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either the  ‘routine replacement’ (control) or ‘clinically indicated replacement’ (intervention) group.  assignment was concealed until randomisation by use of a telephone service. a tag was  placed on the insertion site indicating the study group. all devices for the patient were  managed as per randomised group. the intervention group did not have their ivd re-sited  unless clinically indicated. this decision was made by the treating clinician (not the  investigators) who ordered ivd resite if the device failed or phlebitis occurred, and  ongoing iv treatment was required. the control group had a new device re-located to a  different site by the general medical or nursing staff every 3 days. control devices could also  be removed at any stage by the clinical staff if they were not required, or complications  occurred. clinical nursing and medical staff undertook insertion and follow-up care of all  ivds as per the cdc guidelines [7].    laboratory staff undertaking microbiological culture assessments were blinded to the study  group. due to the nature of the intervention, patients, research, and clinical staff were unable  to be blinded. however, the investigators had no involvement in assessing or documenting  complications.     ivds were assessed by the clinical nursing staff each nursing shift for complications as  part of standard clinical practice in the hospital. times and dates of device insertion and  removal were recorded along with the reason for device removal and any protocol deviations.  a full-time research nurse collected data from the hospital chart and sought clarification from  patients and clinical staff if necessary. microbiological investigations (device tip, blood 


  - 9 -  cultures, site cultures) were performed by the clinical staff on clinical suspicion of infection  by the treating clinician. demographic and clinical data were collected on: age, sex,  diagnosis at hospital admission, phlebitis risk based on tagar et al's classification  (low/medium/high risk) [20], past history of phlebitis, any co-morbidities requiring active  medical treatment (such as type ii diabetes or congestive heart failure), haemoglobin,  concurrent infection at other sites, antibiotic therapy, type of surgery, type of infusate and any  additives (and their level of irritability), vein and skin quality assessment, size of device,  insertion site, health professional inserting the device, and setting for insertion, presence of  other vascular devices wound drains and urinary catheters. vein quality was assessed as  good (vein easy to visualise and easy to palpate with tourniquet on), fair (not easily  visible but can palpate with tourniquet), or poor (veins small, scarred or difficult to  palpate with tourniquet, may require heat pack to aid vasodilation). skin quality was  assessed as good (healthy, well hydrated, elastic), fair (mildly dehydrated, reduced  elasticity), or poor (papery, dehydrated, or reduced elasticity).    analytic approach  the primary outcome was a composite measure of any complication causing unplanned  cannula removal prior to completion of iv treatment. the composite included: phlebitis,  infiltration, occlusion, accidental removal, local infection, and device-related bloodstream  infection.  these were also analysed individually as secondary endpoints. a composite  measure was chosen due to the low rates of these conditions individually, and the  assumption that they are comparable measures of ‘infusion failure’, that is, the device  can no longer be used to deliver treatment. this approach has been used in previous  studies on the topic [15-17]. phlebitis was defined as 2 or more of: pain, erythema,  purulence, streak formation, or a palpable venous cord [3]. local infection and device-related 


  - 10 -  bloodstream infection (bacteremia/fungemia with ≥ 1 positive blood culture obtained from a  peripheral vein, clinical manifestations of infection, and no apparent source for the bsi  except the device with or without positive tip or entry site swab culture) [7]; were defined  using cdc criteria [7]. other secondary outcomes were: time in situ (hours of catheterisation  from insertion to removal, both per patient and per device) [7]; ivds per patient  (number of  peripheral devices inserted to complete the course of treatment) [7]; costs: (calculations based  on 20 minutes nursing or medical insertion time at relevant rates [15], plus the cost of the  required equipment (cannula, insertion pack including dressing and solution, gloves, saline,  syringe, extension tubing and starter pack for all plus fluid bag, tubing and secondary tubing  for medication administration for those patients requiring this) for insertions, nursing time  and equipment to routinely remove ivds that were otherwise functional, and the costs of  treating any complications that occurred (e.g. crbsi). cost calculations were undertaken  from the viewpoint of the hospital using negotiated wage costs and purchasing  agreements for government hospitals in the state of tasmania. costs would be similar  for other australian hospitals.    all randomised patients were analysed by intention to treat. each patient was randomised  once, and could have multiple ivds, with subsequent ivd resites managed as per the  randomised group. relative incidence complication rates per 1000 ivd days and 95%  confidence intervals were calculated to summarise the impact of clinically indicated  replacement relative to 3-day replacement. kaplan meier survival curves were drawn to  compare time to first ivd complication between patients in the two study groups. to assess  for any potential impact of protocol violations, a per protocol analysis was also  undertaken. all clinical and demographic variables were subjected to univariate testing  against the primary endpoint to guide selection of possible covariates for the multivariable 


  - 11 -  model. cox proportional hazards regression modelling examined the impact of: age, gender,  oncology status, number of co-morbidities (nil, 1, 2, or >2), iv gauge, site, vein quality, skin  quality, oral antibiotics, iv antibiotics, wound drain, inserter occupation, initial versus  subsequent ivds, phlebitis in a preceeding ivd, haemoglobin level, parenteral nutrition,  continuous versus intermittent infusion, patient risk category and study group on the outcome  of time to complication events using an additive model [3, 5, 7, 20-25].  in addition, to  adjust for any inherent correlations or co-dependencies in the failure times of ivds (i.e. same  patient multiple failure-time data) within the cox model, we also used the prentice- williams-peterson conditional risk-set method [26]. the mann-whitney test was used to  compare various secondary outcomes between study groups. cost differences were  calculated using arithmetic means and the t-test [27]. p values of < 0.05 were considered  significant. all statistical data were entered and analysed using spss (version 15.0, chicago  il) and stata (version 8.2, college station tx).     results  sample  over a 10 month period, 1,954 patients were screened for eligibility. of these, 788 were  eligible with 362 (46%) recruited into the study. the most frequent exclusion criterion was  altered mental state that precluded consideration of consent as assessed by the research  nurse. altered mental state was generally related to our elderly medical patients, and  the immediate post-operative phase for surgical patients. reasons for exclusion are shown  in figure 1. the 362 patients were randomised into either the routine change group (n=177  participants, 323 devices,) or the clinically indicated replacement group (n=185 participants,  280 devices). in total 50,173 ivd hours were studied (routine change group 26,885 hours,  clinically indicated group 23,288 hours). more patients in the routine change group had an 


  - 12 -  active infection (53% vs 44%) and were receiving iv antibiotics (73% vs 64%). however, as  shown in tables 1 and 2, the two groups were generally comparable at baseline for patient-  and cannula-related factors.     effect of intervention on primary outcome  outcome data were available for all patients. table 3 shows the rates of primary and  secondary outcomes. differences in complication rates between groups were not significantly  different (routine replacement 66.0 per 1000 ivd days, clinical replacement 67.8 per 1,000  ivd days, rr 1.03, 95%ci 0.74, 1.43, p=0.86). as seen in figure 2, the time to first  complication per patient was also not significantly different between groups (km with log  rank p=0.53). on crude rate per ivd the catheters replaced on clinical indication had higher  complication rates (110/280, 39% vs. 91/323, 28%, p=0.004). however, total complication  rates per patient (to deliver the course of iv therapy) were not significantly different  (p=0.39) between clinically indicated (76/185, 41%) and routine resite patients (64/177,  36%).     patient and device related variables considered in the multivariable model were older age,  number of co-morbidities (nil, 1, 2 or >2), smaller cannula size, poor skin or vein integrity,  iv antibiotics, insertion by medical staff and study group. none of these were found to be  statistically significant. the final cox proportional hazards model after adjusting for time,  found study group was not a significant factor (hr 0.98, 95%ci 0.74, 1.30, p=0.89).  variance-adjustment testing for potential multiple-failures per patient (cannula data)  found no inconsistency in significant results compared to the main cox model.    protocol compliance 


  - 13 -  compliance with the study intervention was achieved in 78% (251 of 323) of routinely  replaced ivds removed at day 3 and 100% (280 of 280) ivds resited on clinical  indication. non-compliance in the routine resite group was generally related to high  staff workloads on that day, or staff’s perception that the patient was soon to be  discharged or have therapy completed, and so the ivd remained in situ beyond day 3.  a per protocol analysis was performed including only those patients in the routine  replacement group whose ivds were all actually removed by 96 hours (n=251). this found  no significant difference (km with log rank p=0.16) in the rate of complications between  groups (routine replacement, 92 per 1000 ivd days vs clinically indicated, 68 per 1000 ivd  days).    effect of intervention on secondary outcomes  there was no statistically significant difference in group outcomes for any of: phlebitis  (p=0.34), infiltration (p=0.57), occlusion (p=0.75), or accidental removal (p=0.43). no cases  of local infection, or ivd-related bloodstream infection occurred in either group.      for overall ivd therapy (total cannulation time per patient for all devices), clinical indicated  devices had a median therapy of 120 hours (quartiles 86.5 and 172.5 hours), and those  replaced routinely had median therapy of 113 hours (quartiles 72 and 172 hours) (p=0.21)  for individual ivd dwell times, the clinically indicated group devices had a median dwell of  85 hours (quartiles 51 and 121 hours), and those replaced routinely had median dwell of 71  hours (quartiles 48 and 90 hours) (p<0.001). the maximum ivd dwell time was 1,023  hours (43 days) in the clinical replacement group, and this cannula was still working well on  removal for completion of therapy.    


  - 14 -  the overall number of ivds per patient was significantly less (p=0.004) for those replaced  on clinical indication (mean 1.5, sd 0.8, median 1, quartiles 1 and 2) than for those  routinely replaced (mean 1.8, sd 1.1, median 1, quartiles 1 and 2). a total of 22% of  patients in the routinely replaced group had 3 or more ivds, compared to 9% in the clinical  indication group. a total of 82 (28%) ivds in the routine replacement group were resited  after 3 days, despite functioning well, and ongoing treatment being required (the remainder  removed at this time were no longer required and so not resited, or infusion failure had  already occurred). mean hospital costs per patient for the course of iv therapy were  significantly higher (p<0.001) for those managed with routine resite (mean $55.42, sd  $35.26) compared to resite on clinical indication (mean $43.35, sd $26.78).    discussion  the finding that 3 day routine resite was not an effective intervention was consistent across  the intention to treat primary analysis and the per protocol analysis. there remained no effect  when events were expressed per patient, or per 1,000 ivd days. neither composite nor  individual complication rates differed between groups, and there were no cases of local or  device-related bloodstream infection. it appears safe and practical to leave ivds in situ as  long as they are functioning well, and still needed for clinical treatments.     all ivds will fail eventually, but this study shows that artificially shortening the lifespan of  individual catheters does not reduce the overall complication rates over the course of therapy.  our results indicate that the average duration of iv therapy is 5-6 days, and that many  catheters can remain complication-free for this period. if catheters are not routinely resited,  the median dwell would remain within the 72-96 hours recommended by the cdc, but about  10% would remain in situ for longer (in this study up to 43 days with no complications). our 


  - 15 -  data show that a policy of resite on clinical indication would mean that 1 of every 2 patients  would need a single cannula to receive treatment, whereas a 3 day change policy would  result in only 1 in 5 patients having this scenario, with the rest requiring multiple  cannulations, and therefore additional pain and inconvenience.    the results are consistent with the findings of recent rcts in both hospitals and the  community that have found no benefit in routinely resiting ivds every 3 days [15-17]. in  these studies, many cannulae were inserted by an expert ivd team [15-17], which may have  minimised complications in both groups [19]. our study confirms and extends these findings  into the general medical/surgical setting without an iv team where ivds were inserted by a  variety of nursing and medical staff. data from this study were included in a 2010  cochrane collaboration systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic [18]. this  review included six trials (n=3,455), and reported no clinically important or statistically  significant difference in catheter-related bloodstream infection or phlebitis between  ivds that were routinely resited (at 48-96 hours) or resited on clinical indication, yet  significantly lower costs in the group resited on clinical indication [18].    the belief that routine resite of ivds will prevent complications appears to stem from early  observational studies that noted longer dwell ivds had more complications than shorter  dwell ivds [9, 10]. this is intuitively true, given for example, an ivd in situ for 6 days has  twice the time exposure of risk than an ivd in situ for 3 days. however, this does not prove  that two sequentially inserted ivds (in the same patient), both used for 3 days have a  combined lower risk over time, than the 6-day dwell device. indeed, this and other recent  trials strongly suggest that the risk for the patient over the 6-day period is similar. well- designed cohort studies with modern catheter materials suggest that the daily risk of phlebitis 


  - 16 -  is relatively stable after the first 24 or 48 hours [3, 21, 28-31]. the peak in phlebitis between  24 and 48 hours is likely associated with the time taken by the body to mount a biological  response after the instigation of therapy; those most likely to develop phlebitis will do so at  this time.     the results support the extension of the use of peripheral ivds beyond the 72-96 hours  currently recommended by the cdc [7]. there is incongruity in the cdc recommendations;  these recommend not to routinely resite ivds in children, or in those with limited venous  access. if it is safe in these populations, it is unclear why it would be necessary to routinely  resite adults or those with better veins. higher risk cannulae such as central venous devices  are no longer recommended by the cdc for routine replacement, once trials showed this was  not of benefit [7]. our study also confirms that the cdc guidelines are not always complied  with; a fifth of ivds in the routine change group were not replaced by this time. however,  the per protocol analysis showed that the intervention remained ineffective even for those  who truly had their ivds resited every 3 days.    limitations of the study included a 9% higher frequency of iv antibiotics and concurrent  infection in the routine resite group. this may have put the group at higher risk due to vein  irritation, or conversely protected against bacterial entry. neither variable was significant in  the multivariable model. the unblinded study design was unavoidable, but also a limitation.  our use of clear outcome measures, a full-time research nurse and laboratory staff blinded to  culture assessments should have reduced the risk for potential bias. resource constraints  prematurely ended recruitment, thus reducing the anticipated power of the study from 90% to  80%.    


  - 17 -  routine ivd resite involves pain for patients, staff procedural time, equipment costs and  environmental waste. contemporary evidence suggests the current policy for routine resite  by 72-96 hours is ineffective and should be replaced with a ‘resite on clinical indication”  policy. it remains imperative that clinical staff monitor ivds closely and that a daily review  of the need for continuing therapy is made, with cessation as soon as possible; the only no  risk ivd is no ivd. of the 4.3 million acute hospital admissions in australia each year  (excludes day cases), over half have iv treatment [15, 32]. conservatively, if even 2 million  courses of iv therapy are managed with clinically indicated rather than routine resite, this  would save unnecessary insertion of approximately 660,000 ivds and free up 280,000 hours  of staff insertion time. assuming our costs are similar to those in other australian  hospitals, a change to resite on clinical indication would save approximately aud$24  million nationally each year.    conclusions  although larger, multi-site trials are required, evidence to date suggests that routine resite of  peripheral ivds increases patient discomfort and healthcare costs, but does not reduce ivd  complications as has traditionally been thought.    competing interests  the authors declare that they have no competing interests.    authors’ contributions  cmr designed the study, applied for funding and drafted the manuscript. dm participated in  study design and manuscript preparation, and managed the study. jm recruited patients,
