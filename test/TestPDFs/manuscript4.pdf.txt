3    abstract  background: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is caused by abnormal  accumulation of lipids within liver cells. its prevalence is increasing in developed  countries in association with obesity, and it represents a risk factor for non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis (nash), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. since nafld is  usually asymptomatic at diagnosis, new non-invasive approaches are needed to  determine the hepatic lipid content in terms of diagnosis, treatment and control of  disease progression. here, we investigated the potential of magnetic resonance  imaging (mri) to quantitate and monitor the hepatic triglyceride concentration in  humans.   methods: prospective study of diagnostic accuracy from 129 consecutive adult  patients (97 with obesity and 32 non-obese) that compares multi-echo mri fat fraction,  grade of steatosis estimated by histopathology, and biochemical measurement of  hepatic triglyceride concentration (i.e. folch value).   results: mri fat fraction positively correlates with the grade of steatosis estimated on  a 0-3 scale by histopathology. however, this correlation value was stronger when mri  fat fraction was linked to folch value, resulting in a novel equation to predict the  hepatic triglyceride concentration [mg of triglycerides/g of liver tissue = 5.082 +  (432.104 * multi-echo mri fat fraction)]. validation of this formula in 31 additional  patients (24 obese and 7 controls) resulted in robust correlation between the measured  and estimated folch values. multivariate analysis showed that none of the variables  investigated improves the folch prediction capacity of the equation. obese patients  show increased steatosis compared to controls using mri fat fraction and folch value.  bariatric surgery improved mri fat fraction values and the folch estimated in obese  patients one year after surgery.   conclusions: multi-echo mri is an accurate approach to determine the hepatic lipid  concentration by using our novel equation, representing an economic non-invasive  method to diagnose and monitor steatosis in humans.      keywords: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; magnetic resonance imaging; hepatic fat  concentration; obesity; bariatric surgery, diagnosis.         


4    background  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is triggered by intra-hepatocellular  accumulation of lipids (mainly triglycerides) and affects up to 30% of the western  population [1, 2]. its pathogenesis usually involves the so-called metabolic syndrome  linked to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and/or insulin resistance.  although nafld generally presents a benign course, it may progress to non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis (nash) and to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular  carcinoma [2 ].  nafld is usually asymptomatic at diagnosis [3]. therefore, determination of the  hepatic lipid content is posing a major challenge in terms of identification, treatment  and control of the disease progression [4]. currently, the standard procedure to  evaluate hepatic steatosis is the histopathological examination of cross-liver sections  and the semi-quantitative estimation of the percentage of hepatocytes (0%-100%)  containing macrovesicular fat, which is graded on a 0-3 scale [5]. however, this is an  expensive and invasive practice that presents inherent risks. moreover, it only provides  a 2-dimensional (2d) estimation of a particular biopsy and is subject to inter-individual  visual evaluation depending on the pathologist training, which usually results in  overestimation of the liver fat content [6]. on the other hand, evaluation of steatosis  using computational image analysis of histology slides is possible [7, 8], but is not  carried out routinely in clinical practice. therefore, it is essential to establish new non- invasive approaches to accurately determine the hepatic fat concentration, allowing the  correct diagnosis and monitoring of steatosis.   magnetic resonance imaging (mri) represents a potential non-invasive technique  for assessing hepatic steatosis in 3d [9]. it measures the proportion of the mobile  proton density of the liver that is attributable to fat [10]. increasing evidence, using fat- water phantoms and/or histopathological semi-quantitative analysis of hepatic fat as  reference standards, suggests that mri may represent an accurate method to  determine the hepatic lipid content [10, 11]. however, additional research is still  needed to validate this hypothesis and, more importantly, to test the potential of mri as  a tool to determine the hepatic triglyceride concentration (i.e. folch value).  the purpose of our prospective study of diagnostic accuracy was to evaluate the  potential of multi-echo mri to quantitate the hepatic triglyceride concentration. multi- echo mri fat fractions were compared with the hepatic steatosis determined by either  histopathology and biochemical methods in patients operated for morbid obesity or who  underwent liver surgery. moreover, we analysed the role of multi-echo mri to monitor  steatosis in morbidly obese patients after bariatric surgery. our results indicate that 


5    multi-echo mri is a precise method to determine the hepatic triglyceride concentration  utilizing a novel equation generated, and may be routinely employed in the clinical  practice to diagnose and monitor steatosis.    methods  patient selection and study design  we designed a prospective and cross-sectional single-site study of diagnostic accuracy  (from january 2009 to january 2014), which was approved by the ethics committee of  the donostia university hospital as defined by the spanish law and european  directives. an informed consent form approved by the institutional review board was  signed by all patients before starting the study.   for the non-obese group, we included during 2009 all consecutive patients referred  to our hospital for hepatic surgery due to different etiologies without underlying liver  disease. inclusion criteria: body mass index (bmi) < 35 kilograms per square meter.  on the other hand, we included between 2010 and 2013 all consecutive obese  patients referred to our hospital for bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve or gastric bypass)  or for partial liver resection due to metastatic liver disease without underlying hepatic  disease. inclusion criteria for obese patients: body mass index (bmi) ≥ 35 kilograms  per square meter. all the patients in this group ranged between 36-63 bmi and are  classified as obesity class ii (bmi = 35-39.9) or iii (bmi ≥40) by the oms [12]. all obese  patients undergoing bariatric surgery had surgical indication for bmi ≥ 40 or bmi = 35- 39.9 with significant morbidity [12].  multi-echo mri was performed in all patients under study the day before surgery,  and a liver biopsy was obtained at the moment of the bariatric or hepatic surgery.  importantly, the mri-biopsy period was less than 24h. liver biopsies were processed  for histopathological studies as well as for quantification of the hepatic fat concentration  measured by a lipid assay (see below). expert professionals involved in each  quantification method (i.e. mri, histopathology and lipid assay) performed the analysis  blindly.  a validation group with 31 additional patients (24 obese and 7 non-obese) was also  included between june 2013 and january 2014 to confirm the efficiency of our new  formula to predict the hepatic folch value from multi-echo mri. thus, multi-echo mri  before surgery as well as liver biopsy at the moment of operation were obtained from  these patients to compare the measured (by folch) and the predicted (by mri) liver  triglyceride concentration. 


6    finally, the aforementioned obese patients received a second multi-echo mri one  year after surgery in order to quantitate and monitor steatosis. moreover, a multivariate  analysis (initial folch estimated, total weight, weight loss, age and gender) of multi- echo mri fat fraction and folch estimated was performed.    clinical data  gender and age were considered in all patients. body measurements included weight  and standing height at the moment of the liver biopsy. the bmi was calculated from  these values. the presence of associated diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia  and obstructive sleep apnoea was checked in all patients. in addition, treatment with  drugs (i.e. contraceptives, statins, immunosuppressives, antidepressants, nifedipines,  hormones and paracetamol) was also considered. biological data for each patient  included hematological parameters, liver function tests and lipid profiles.     liver histology  liver biopsies were double-blind examined by two expert liver pathologists. all biopsies  were obtained from a hepatic wedge in the left anterior liver. tissue samples were fixed  in 10% formalin solution and embedded in paraffin. sections 4 µm thick were routinely  stained with hematoxylin-eosin. furthermore, liver steatosis was reported as a semi- quantitative evaluation of the percentage of hepatocytes (0%-100%) containing  macrovesicular fat (i.e. lipid droplets equal to or larger than the size of the nucleus,  often displacing the nucleus) or microvesicular fat (i.e. numerous small fat droplets  surrounding a centrally located nucleus). results were expressed in terms of fat  percentage in hepatocytes and ranged from 0 to 3 (i.e. 0: no fat, 1: up to 33% fat, 2: 33- 66% fat, and 3: >66% fat) [13].     hepatic lipid assay  the lipid concentration of the liver was determined according to the method described  by folch et al. [14]. this biochemical approach determines the triglyceride  concentration in liver samples (mg of triglyceride/g of liver tissue) and was used as a  gold standard (i.e. reference method) to compare with both mri data and histology.  this method, with some minor modifications, continues to be considered the classic  and most reliable approach for quantitatively extracting lipids [15]. two experienced  researchers performed the folch determinations from liver biopsies without knowing  any clinical data or mri/histological results. 


7    briefly, liver tissue was washed with saline solution to eliminate any traces of blood,  and subsequently homogenized with 2:1 chloroform/methanol solution. samples were  then incubated at 50°c for 30 min and with 2ml of kcl 0.1m to speed up the phase  separation process; this mixture was shaken for 1 min. samples were kept for 2h at  4°c, and then centrifuged at 2,000–3,000 rpm for 20 min to facilitate the separation of  the upper phase (or aqueous methanol dragging), and the lower phase (or chloroform  phase) containing the lipids. most of the aqueous phase was removed, and the  chloroform phase adjusted to a known final volume with chloroform. 1ml of the  chloroform phase was transferred into a tube previously weighed and the solution was  evaporated by drying using a nitrogen stream. the tube was weighed again and the  amount of fat calculated by gravimetric method. finally, lipids were dissolved in  isopropanol and triglycerides measured by spectrophotometry using a commercial kit  from spinreact (santesteve de bas, spain).    multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging (mri)  the multi-echo mri technique to assess the tissue fat content was performed as we  previously reported in animal models [16]. briefly, this method is based on a 3d multi- echo gradient sequence acquired in axial orientation with 12 different echoes (te  min=1.04 ms, δte=0.78 ms, te final=25.14 ms, tr=72 ms, flip angle=25º, fov  375/328 mm, matrix resolution 232/129). images were achieved for spectral analysis of  the mri signal to distinguish between fat and water content in each image pixel. the  3d acquisition (10 consecutive slices: slice thickness = 12 mm) was performed in a  single breath-hold of 20 sec that resulted in a final image of the whole liver anatomy. all  the acquisitions were carried out in a 1.5t achieva system (philips healthcare, the  netherlands). an integrated quadrature body coil was used in obese patients to fit  better inside the scanner. for non-obese patients, images were acquired using a 16- channel phased array coil maintaining the same image parameters previously  described in the acquisition method.  quantitative analysis of the images was performed following previously published  methodology [16]. this approach was implemented in an in-line pride tool that runs in  a mr work station (extended work space, philips healthcare, the netherlands).  importantly, native multi-echo images were not directly analyzed by the radiologist. the  software automatically generates the water and fat intensity maps, the water and fat  r2* (reciprocal of t2*) maps, and fat fraction maps. water and fat signal maps are  then analyzed by the radiologist as a conventional parametric map [region of interest  (roi) analysis] to calculate the final fat fraction measured as percentage. the analysis  of 3 regions of interest was performed in the fat fraction maps manually dressed in 


8    segment iii, near to the lower border of the liver, avoiding vascular vessels. the  average of three measured fat fraction values was calculated for each patient to  provide the final fat fraction content. the radiologist was not aware of other test results.  therefore, the data are not subject to any bias.     statistical analysis  quantitative variables were expressed as mean + standard deviation and categorical  variables as absolute and relative frequencies. coefficient of variation was estimated  as a measure of dispersion of continuous data. we used the student t test for statistical  comparisons between two groups of normally distributed variables, and mann-whitney  tests for non-parametric methods. the association of variables with the lipid content in  liver tissue (folch and histology) was carried out by linear regression analysis and  pearson correlation coefficient (r) in the case of continuous variables, and by one-way  anova for categorical variables (or non-parametric tests when necessary).  we considered the folch determination as the reference test of the liver fat content.  to measure the ability of mri to provide a quantitative liver fat content, we used a  linear regression model. all the variables showing a relation with the folch  determination in the univariate analysis with a p value lower than 0.20 were selected  for a multivariate model. using a backwards stepwise linear model we estimated their  ability to contribute to improve folch prediction over the model with mri alone.   we constructed a calibration graph for the validation dataset and studied the relation  between estimated with measured folch using a linear regression model.   to assess the effect of clinical parameters on liver fat improvement as measured by  mri (difference between initial mri-estimated and final mri-estimated liver fat  content), we used backwards stepwise linear regression.  results were considered to be statistically significant at p<0.05. statistical analysis  was performed using stata® se v13 software (statacorp. lp, drive college station,  texas usa).               


9    results  clinical and biological human data  one hundred and twenty nine adult patients (52 men and 77 women) with a mean age  of 50 years (50.2±14.3) were included in the study between january 2009 and january  2014 (table 1). patients were clustered in two groups: a) a control group that  underwent liver surgery (n=32), and b) a group of obese patients (n=97). patients in the  control group underwent partial liver resection for different etiologies that justified the  intervention during 2009, i.e. 22 metastases, 3 hepatocarcinomas, 1  cholangiocarcinoma, 3 adenomas and 3 hemangiomas. among the obese patients, 86  underwent bariatric surgery and 11 partial liver resection between 2010 and 2013.  the group of obese patients presented a mean age (46.7±13.4 years) that was  lower than that of the control group (60.9±11.5 years) (p<0.0001), since obesity was  observed in middle-aged persons, and the control group involved liver surgery in older  patients. on the other hand, as expected, the group of obese patients showed  increased body weight (120.7±26.3 vs 71.9±13.6 kg) and body mass index (bmi;  44.6±7.9 vs 26±4.5 kg/m2) compared to the control group (p<0.0001 in both  comparisons), as well as increased obstructive sleep apnoea (33% vs 3.1%; p<0.001),  serum triglycerides (163.3±154.8 vs 106.9±54.1 mg/dl; p<0.01) and hepatic  triglyceride content (94.5±57.1 vs 33.3±28.3 mg/g; p<0.0001). finally, the serological  levels of alkaline phosphatase (alp) were decreased in the obese patients compared  to controls (71.6±22.4 vs 99.9±48.5 u/l; p<0.01).    obese patients showed increased hepatic steatosis compared to controls by  histopathological examination  the analysis of steatosis by histopathology showed different degrees of hepatic fat  content between the obese and control group (fig. 1). 53.12% of patients in the control  group had no hepatic fat, 34.38% showed mild, 9.38% moderate and 3.12% severe  macrovesicular steatosis. on the other hand, 11.34% of patients with obesity had no  hepatic fat, 31.96% showed mild, 41.24% moderate and 15.46% severe  macrovesicular steatosis. overall, the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in this study  population was 78.29% (101 of 129 patients had macrovesicular steatosis ≥ 1 at  histopathological analysis). importantly, no adverse events associated to the liver  biopsy collection were reported in any patient.       


10    correlation analysis between multi-echo mri fat fraction and histopathological  estimation of hepatic steatosis in humans  we evaluated in all 129 patients under study the potential correlation between the  multi-echo mri fat fraction and the semi-quantitative analysis of liver steatosis by  histopathological measurement (fig. 2). our data showed that multi-echo mri fat  fractions positively correlate with the grade of steatosis estimated by histopathological  measurements (r=0.77, r2=0.60; p<0.0001). however, importantly, although significant  differences in the multi-echo mri fat fraction values were found between all the groups  of patients graded on a 0-3 scale of steatosis, there was intragroup variability in the  mri scores [mean coefficient of variation (cv) = 70.6%, fig. 2]. importantly, no  adverse events associated to multi-echo mri were reported in any patient.    correlation analysis between the histopathological estimation of hepatic  steatosis in humans and the biochemical measurement of the hepatic lipid  concentration  we studied the potential correlation between the semi-quantitative analysis of steatosis  in human liver biopsies by histopathology and the direct quantification of the hepatic  lipid concentration (i.e. folch value) (fig. 3). our data indicated that folch values  positively correlate with the grade of steatosis estimated by histopathological  measurements (r=0.71, r2=0.50; p<0.05). in this regard, significant differences in the  folch values were found between the histological grades 1, 2 and 3, but not between  grades 0 and 1. moreover, importantly, there was intragroup folch variability in all 4  groups of steatosis determined histopathologically on a 0-3 scale (mean cv = 72.9%,  fig. 3).    correlation analysis between multi-echo mri fat fraction and the biochemical  measurement of the hepatic lipid concentration  next, we evaluated the potential correlation between the multi-echo mri fat fraction of  human livers and the direct quantitation of steatosis through the biochemical  measurement of the hepatic triglyceride concentration (folch value) (fig. 4a). our  results indicated that the multi-echo mri fat fractions positively correlate with the folch  values (r =0.90, adjusted r2 =0.81; p<0.0001) resulting in the following equation:     folch (mg of triglycerides/g of liver) = 5.082 + (432.104 * multi-echo mri fat fraction)   


11    calculation of the hepatic fat concentration through the multi-echo mri fat  fraction  the aforementioned equation was evaluated with a new validation group of patients.  thus, 31 additional adult patients (24 obese and 7 controls) underwent multi-echo mri,  and their fat fraction was employed to predict their hepatic fat concentration (folch) by  using the formula. next, these predicted folch values were compared with the direct  biochemical measurement of the hepatic fat concentration. our data showed that the  aforementioned equation is able to predict the hepatic triglyceride concentration with  strong correlation between a) the biochemically measured folch values and b) the  estimated folch values obtained with the formula (r2=0.98; p<0.0001) (fig. 4b).     univariate analyses of hepatic fat concentration and multivariate evaluation of  multi-echo mri prediction  we tested the role of the different variables analysed with the folch (tables 2 and 3).  the univariate studies showed that folch values are lower in male than female  patients, and higher in patients with apnoea (p<0.05 and p<0.0001, respectively; table  2). in addition, folch values correlate negatively with age (p<0.05; table 3), and  positively with bmi (p<0.0001; table 3), alanine aminotransferase (alt), triglycerides  and cholesterol (p<0.05 for all three comparisons; table 3). on the other hand, the  multivariate analysis indicated that these variables do not improve the folch predictive  capacity obtained by the aforementioned formula (data not shown).    obese patients show increased steatosis compared to controls by multi-echo  mri and folch value, which is improved after bariatric surgery  finally, from the aforementioned 97 obese patients, all that had liver resection (n=11)  and those who underwent bariatric surgery at least one year before (n=56) were  monitored with a second multi-echo mri one year after the operation in order to  quantitate steatosis. in this regard, since it is a prospective study, 30 patients did not  fulfill the requirement of a year after bariatric surgery and had not undergone the  second multi-echo mri. obese patients present increased liver steatosis compared to  controls using multi-echo mri fat fraction and folch value (p<0.0001; figures 5a,b,  respectively). however, patients who underwent bariatric surgery decreased the multi- echo mri fat fraction signal intensities and the folch estimated after one year of  operation (p<0.0001; figures 6a-c). this effect was not observed in obese patients  who did not receive bariatric surgery (figures 6d-f). multivariate analysis indicated that  the folch value estimated before bariatric surgery and the weight loss (kg) both 


12    improve the folch estimated 1 year after surgery (p<0.0001; table 4). initial weight,  gender and age do not correlate with the improvement of steatosis.    discussion  the key findings reported here indicate that mri is a non-invasive technique able to  quantitate the hepatic triglyceride concentration in nafld. our prospective data from  129 adult patients demonstrated that multi-echo mri fat fraction strongly correlates (r  =0.90/adjusted r2=0.81) with the biochemical measurement of the hepatic lipid  concentration (i.e. folch), resulting in a novel equation: folch (mg of triglycerides/g of  liver tissue) = 5.082 + (432.104 * multi-echo mri fat fraction). this formula was  afterwards validated in 31 additional adult patients, showing strong correlation between  the folch measured and mri-estimated folch values (r2=0.98; p<0.0001). in addition,  multi-echo mri fat fraction positively correlates with the semi-quantitative  measurement of steatosis by histopathological examinations (r=0.77/adjusted r2=0.60),  but correlation values were lower than those obtained when multi-echo mri fat fraction  was correlated with folch. these data, together with the correlation values between  folch and semi-quantitative measurement of steatosis by histopathological  examinations (r=0.71/adjusted r2=0.50), indicated that the latter is not an accurate  method to determinate the hepatic fat content, and folch should be used as an  appropriate gold standard for nafld. folch prediction obtained by multi-echo mri was  not improved when other variables were included in the equation. obese patients show  increased steatosis compared to controls using folch-measured and mri-estimated  values. bariatric surgery was followed by decrease in liver fat content as estimated by  mri one year after surgery, and a substantial part of this improvement is explained by  the measured folch value before surgery and the weight loss after surgery. our data  are consistent with the notion that multi-echo mri is a non-invasive technique that  allows the appropriate estimation of the hepatic fat concentration, and can be  employed to diagnose and monitor liver steatosis in humans.  hepatic fat quantification is receiving increasing attention in clinical practice since  the prevalence of steatosis associated with obesity is dramatically affecting developed  countries [2, 3]; moreover, it is also important for liver transplantation since 30% or  more fat content contraindicates liver donation [18]. therefore, it is essential to  establish new non-invasive approaches to accurately determine the hepatic fat  concentration, allowing the correct diagnosis and monitoring of steatosis. up to now,  there have been no specific biochemical or serological tests able to diagnose the  presence of fatty liver, and even less, methods to quantitate the degree of liver 


13    steatosis [2]. the standard procedure is the histological estimation of the percentage of  hepatocytes containing macrovesicular fat [5], which possesses inherent invasive risks  and is subject to the variability of visual estimation between observers [9].  mr imaging (mri) and 1h mr spectroscopy (mrs) are currently considered the  most promising and sensitive non-invasive methods to assess the total liver fat content  [4, 19, 20], being postulated as potential screening tools for patients at risk of  developing nafld (i.e. with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and/or  nutritional disorders) [3, 16]. mri can be performed using gradient-echo chemical shift  imaging (dixon method) as t1-weighted dual echo, triple echo, or multi-echo [20].  however, it is important to take into account that liver iron deposition is able to distort  local magnetic fields responsible for t2* shortening, and may ultimately result in signal  intensity loss. given the high prevalence of iron deposition in the liver and the  considerable variations of t2* of the liver with consequent errors in the quantification of  liver steatosis, t2* bias cannot be considered negligible and must be taken into  account. in this regard, multi-echo techniques can easily correct for t2* decay and thus  should be used to give reliable results [20, 21].  some studies have recently evaluated the diagnostic potential of mri techniques  (i.e. two-point dixon, three-point dixon, dual, spin echo method and multi-echo  gradient-echo) as non-invasive methods to quantitate steatosis. they compared mri  with semi-quantitative analysis of steatosis by histopathological grading, showing  different degrees of correlation [1, 10, 17, 22, 23]. it is important to remark that the  mri-biopsy time interval is a key factor in improving the correlation score, since the  hepatic fat content may change over time. in this regard, best correlations were  obtained with a mri-biopsy period of 7 days or less [10].  here, 129 adult patients were included in our prospective study. ninety seven  patients present obesity, a risk factor for hepatic steatosis, and the other 32 were non- obese patients with potential low grades of steatosis who underwent liver resections for  several etiologies but without underlying liver disease. our data indicated that multi- echo mri fat fraction positively correlates with the semi-quantitative measurement of  steatosis by histopathological examinations. importantly, the mri-biopsy period in our  study was less than 24h, resulting in a robust interpretation of the data from this long  cohort of patients. however, histopathological analysis of steatosis is not an adequate  gold standard for mri or 1h mrs, since it is a 2d semi-quantitative technique  susceptible to inter-individual visual estimation [9]. in this regard, the folch method is  considered the most reliable approach to extract and quantitate lipids [24]. it gives 3d  quantitation of the hepatic triglyceride content, being an appropriate gold standard [9].  this methodology is not frequently used in clinical practice since it destroys the tissue 


14    and therefore cannot be submitted for histological analysis, being important features  such as inflammation, fibrosis or iron deposition not evaluated [9]. our data showed  that the histopathological estimation of steatosis positively correlates with folch,  although the correlation value was modest, indicating that the semi-quantitative  analysis of steatosis presents folch variability. all of these data indicate that folch is  the appropriate 3d approach to determine the hepatic fat concentration and the correct  gold standard for nafld.  we and others [16, 25-27] have recently reported positive correlations between mri  and folch in animal models of nafld. thus, we found using experimental (n=40) and  control (n=10) rat groups that multi-echo mri strongly correlates with folch (r2 = 0.87)  [16]. there are no available studies in the literature, except for a recent pilot study with  18 adult patients who underwent cholecistectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis [28],  that compare the analysis of hepatic steatosis by mri and the biochemical  quantification of triglycerides in human liver biopsies. our results from a larger cohort of  adult patients showed that multi-echo mri fat fraction strongly correlates with the  folch, resulting in a novel linear regression equation to predict the hepatic triglyceride  concentration from multi-echo mri fat fraction measurements. this formula was  afterwards validated in 31 additional patients, showing strong correlation between the  measured and estimated folch values. thus, obese patients show increased steatosis  compared to controls using multi-echo mri fat fraction and folch value, and bariatric  surgery decreased steatosis in these patients one year after operation. although the  best method to check the accuracy of the developed equation would be the folch  measurement 12 months after surgery, there are ethical problems due to inherent  methodological risks. in addition, the mri-estimated folch value obtained before  bariatric surgery and the weight loss (kg) both positively correlate with the improvement  of steatosis after one year operation  these data strongly suggest that mri is a valuable diagnostic tool not only to  estimate the hepatic lipid concentration, but is also a non-invasive technique to monitor  the changes in steatosis occurring in liver tissue. mri software may automatically  generate the fat fraction and, by using our new formula, determine the triglyceride  concentration without any inter-observer bias. in addition, multi-echo mri is a more  economic approach than folch measurement; thus, mri costs usually are not as much  of those resulting from the folch technique, which include ultrasound-guided liver  biopsy and the triglyceride measurement. however, these costs may vary between  different hospitals and countries. overall, this new equation may represent an  innovative clinical tool to diagnose and monitor steatosis in patient groups with risk to 


15    develop nafld, and may also help to discard liver donations of individuals with high  fat content.    conclusions  our results identify multi-echo mri as an appropriate non-invasive approach to predict  the hepatic lipid concentration using our novel formula. since multi-echo softwares are  usually available in mri units, this may represent an economic non-invasive method to  diagnose and monitor steatosis in risk groups with obesity and/or metabolic syndrome.     abbreviations used in this manuscript:   alp, alkaline phosphatase; alt, alanine aminotransferase; ast, aspartate  aminotransferase; bmi, body mass index; cv, coefficient of variation; fov, field of  view; ggt, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase; mri, magnetic resonance imaging; mrs,  1h magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nafld, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; nash,  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; std. dev, standard deviation; te, echo time; δte, interval  of echo time; tr, repetition time; 3d, three dimensional; 2d, two dimensional.     competing interests: none.    authors´ contributions:   rj-a designed the study, performed the surgical interventions and obtained the liver  biopsies, carried out the statistical analysis, discussed and interpreted the data, and  drafted the manuscript.  jie designed the study, carried out the statistical analysis, discussed and interpreted  the data, and drafted the manuscript.  ab designed the study, performed the surgical interventions and obtained the liver  biopsies, discussed and interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.  lb designed the study, carried out the statistical analysis, discussed and interpreted  the data, and drafted the manuscript.  jma designed the study, carried out the mri technique and analysis, discussed and  interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.  eg designed the study, carried out the mri technique and analysis, discussed and  interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.  eh designed the study, collected the liver biopsies and the data, discussed and  interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.
