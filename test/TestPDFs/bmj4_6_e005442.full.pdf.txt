meta-analyses) checklist for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.7 we carried out this systematic review in accordance with the study protocol (see online supplementary appendix 1). peer-reviewed journal articles and conference abstracts that reported the results of a ran- domised controlled trial and met the following eligibility criteria were eligible for inclusion: (1) trials reporting the effect of dpp-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxaglip- tin, linagliptin, alogliptin) on the hba1c level in partici- pants with type 2 diabetes who were either drug naïve, or on background therapy with metformin or other oral agents; (2) lasting at least 76 weeks and (3) having ﬁnal and intermediate assessment of hba1c, with the intermedi- ate point assessed between 24 and 52 weeks. we have shown that the relation between the hba1c response to dpp-4 inhibitors and time is quite linear until between 24 and 52 weeks.8 we included primary trials and extension trials. we excluded trials if the intervention included the initiation of two agents at the same time, and the doses of dpp-4 inhibitors were different from those approved in the clinical practice (sitagliptin, 100 mg once daily; vildagliptin, 50 mg twice daily; saxagliptin, 5 mg once daily; linagliptin, 5 mg once daily; alogliptin, 25 mg once daily). the search had no language restriction; however, we excluded reviews, editorials, comments, letters and abstracts. search strategy we performed an electronic search for randomised trials evaluating dpp-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes through december 2013. we searched medline, embase, scopus and web of knowledge using the following terms as medical subject heading and keywords: type 2 diabetes (t2dm, niddm, non-insulin-dependent diabetes), glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin a1c, hba1c, a1c), dpp-4 inhibitors (sita- gliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin), clinical trials. we searched for additional trials in the prescribing information documents of approved medica- tions, at relevant web sites (eg, http://www.clinicalstudy results.org and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), and in per- sonal reference lists of recovered articles. study selection, data extraction and quality assessment the relevance of studies was assessed with a hierarchical approach on the basis of title, abstract and the full manuscript. two reviewers (ke and dg) independently screened the titles and abstracts of identiﬁed citations to select those requiring full-text assessment. where there was disagreement, a third reviewer (mim) assessed the records to reach a consensus. full-text articles were further assessed and data were entered into a prespeci- ﬁed table that included information on authors, year of publication, sample size, type of dpp-4 inhibitor, dur- ation of follow-up, comparator drug, baseline hba1c and outcomes. of the selected trials, only study arms assessing the efﬁcacy of dpp-4 inhibitors were included in the analysis, whereas any other arm (placebo or com- parator drug) of the same trial was excluded. data analysis we used the cochrane collaboration’s tool to assess risk of bias at the outcome level.9 bias was assessed in dupli- cate with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. the assessed domains were random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment and com- pleteness of outcome data. we used the difference between decrease of hba1c from baseline at the end of follow-up (76–104 weeks) versus a1c decrease at intermediate assessments (24– 52 weeks) during dpp-4 inhibitor administration as an index of glycaemic durability. the difference between ﬁnal and intermediate hba1c assessment was the primary end point. to calculate the overall difference between the two periods, each study was weighted by the reciprocal of the variance for hba1c change. in a conser- vative approach, the random-effect estimates of mean dif- ferences, which allow for variation of true effects across studies, were taken as ‘main results’. because variances for hba1c change between ﬁnal and intermediate end points were not directly reported, they were calculated by assuming a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.5. a sensitivity ana- lysis was performed assuming a correlation of 0.25 and 0.75; subgroup analyses were also performed for primary trials, extension trials and ‘add-on’ metformin trials. heterogeneity between studies was assessed by using q statistic and i2.10 a p value of q statistic less than 0.10 was considered signiﬁcant. data were analysed using stata, v.11.0 (stata corp., college station, texas, usa). results a total of 751 citations were identiﬁed (ﬁgure 1) from electronic searches. a further 11 relevant publications were identiﬁed as cited by included trial reports. after removing duplicates, we screened 461 citations. based on the title and abstract, 447 were assessed as ineligible. the full text of the remaining 14 articles was assessed for eligibility. further assessment of these articles revealed that two did not meet the inclusion criteria, one because the dose of saxagliptin was twofold higher than the recommended 5 mg daily dose,11 and the other because the intermediate hb1c assessment occurred at 12 weeks.12 duration and settings a total of 12 articles were eligible for inclusion.13–24 all studies were randomised controlled trials (table 1); most trials were multinational and sponsored by industry. the trials were published between 2008 and 2013. six trials19–24 were an extension of previous randomised trials (table 1). all trials were double blind, including the six extension trials. intervention all trials assessed the effect of a dpp-4 inhibitor versus placebo or a comparator drug on hba1c level in 2 esposito k, chiodini p, maiorino mi, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005442. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005442 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


patients with type 2 diabetes. in ﬁve trials,14–16 20 24 the dpp-4 inhibitor was added to ongoing metformin treat- ment; in three trials, the patients were either drug naive13 19 or suspended the previous treatment21; in the remaining four trials, the dpp-4 inhibitor was added to glyburide,22 a thiazolidinedione23 or to a multiple18 or variable17 antidiabetic therapy. outcomes all trials included a deﬁnition of the primary outcome, which was the change in hba1c from baseline to the end of the follow-up in 10 trials.13–16 19–24 risk of bias all trials were deemed to have a low risk of selection bias (random sequence generation) and most trials were assessed as having a low risk of attrition bias (ﬁgure 2). most trials provided incomplete information on alloca- tion concealment, blinding of participants and person- nel, and blinding of outcome assessment. primary outcome trial ﬁndings are summarised in table 2. the difference in hba1c changes between ﬁnal and intermediate points averaged 0.22% (95% ci 0.15% to 0.29%, p<0.0001). there was substantial heterogeneity between the results of trials included in the pooled analysis of the primary outcome (χ2 test for heterogeneity, p<0.0001; i2=91%). sensitivity analysis assuming lower (0.25) or higher (0.75) correlation coefﬁcients of variance did not change results (0.21% and 0.22%, respectively, p<0.0001). subgroup analyses evaluated whether differ- ences existed between primary or extension studies, or if the addition of the dpp-4 inhibitor to metformin behaved differently from the other studies. estimates of differences were not signiﬁcantly affected by the analysis of the six extension trials (0.24%, 0.02 to 0.46, p=0.036), or the ﬁve trials in which the dpp-4 inhibitor was added to metformin (0.24%, 0.16 to 0.32, p<0.0001; table 2). discussion declining β-cell function is the predominant reason for deterioration in glucose tolerance and largely explains the difﬁculty in maintaining target levels of hba1c with traditional glucose-lowering agents. the idea that dpp-4 inhibitors may alleviate β-cell death in animal models seems still attractive5 and potentially may be associated figure 1 flow diagram of literature search, screening and selection for analysis. esposito k, chiodini p, maiorino mi, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005442. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005442 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


with long glycaemic durability. to the best of our knowl- edge, no other analysis assessed the glucose-lowering effect of dpp-4 inhibitors as a function of time in studies with long follow-up. we found that hba1c decrease at the end of treatment with dpp-4 inhibitors was signiﬁ- cantly lower than that recorded at intermediate points, suggesting that the glucose-lowering effect of dpp-4 inhi- bitors declines with time. although extended trials are more likely to be biased, as those patients who had loss of glycaemic control were not enrolled in the extension part of the randomised trial, extension studies behave as primary studies in terms of glycaemic durability with dpp-4 inhibitors. the robustness of our analysis is further supported by the results of the two excluded trials. one trial11 was a phase 3, double-blind, active-controlled trial with 1306 patients randomised to four different treatments includ- ing a saxagliptin (10 mg daily) arm; at 76 weeks, adjusted mean change from baseline hba1c was −1.55%, but the highest decrease from baseline occurred at 30 weeks and averaged −1.9%. the other trial12 was a phase iib, open-label, 78-week extension study of a 12-week blinded trial; in one arm, 56 patients received sitagliptin as add-on to metformin. at 90 weeks, the hba1c change from baseline was −0.4%, with the greatest reduction (−0.58%) occurring at 18 weeks. our study has its limitations. first, a 2-year span is not the optimal time frame to assess glycaemic durability which needs more time.25 the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness (grade) study seeks to compare the effects of four drugs (sulfonylureas, dpp-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and insulin) when combined with metformin in adult patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and is focused on glycaemic durability.26 hopefully, the results of grade will provide guidance to clinicians about the most appropriate medications to treat type 2 diabetes. however, with recruitment over 3 years and an average follow-up time of 4.8 years, results will be available not before 2019. second, the heterogeneity of the studies was high; however, the estimates were not affected by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. third, the number of trials included may be seen as relatively scarce; on the other hand, 12 studies may be enough to have a trend. finally, the intermediate observation happened over a long period, which can be seen as a limitation; however, we have shown that the relation between the hba1c response to dpp-4 inhibitors and time is quite linear during the ﬁrst year of treatment, without differ- ences at any intermediate points (12, 24 or 52 weeks).8 in conclusion, the analysis of 12 randomised trials with duration up to 108 weeks suggests that the effect of dpp-4 inhibitors on hba1c decreases during the second year of treatment. further research with a longer follow-up hopefully will allow to individualise the characteristics of the diabetic patient who beneﬁts most from dpp-4 inhibitors in terms of glycaemic durability.t ab le 1 c ha ra ct er is tic s of tri al s in cl ud ed in th e an al ys is a ut ho r, ye ar an d re fe re nc e p at ie nt s’ nu m be r ty pe of d p p -4 in hi bi to rs fo llo w -u p w ee ks c om pa ra to r dr ug a dd -o n to b as el in e h ba 1c % (m m ol /m ol ) δ h ba 1c (% ) t 1 :2 4– 52 w ee ks δ h ba 1c (% ) t 2 :7 6– 10 4 w ee ks d iff er en ce (% ) t 2 -t 1 95 % c i fo le y, 20 09 1 3 40 9 v ild a 10 4 g lic la zi de n ai ve 8. 5 (6 9) −0 .9 − 0. 5 0. 4 (0 .2 0 to 0. 58 ) m at th ew s, 20 10 1 4 10 51 v ild a 10 4 g lim ep iri de m et fo rm in 7. 3 (5 6) −0 .2 5 − 0. 1 0. 15 (0 .1 1 to 0. 19 ) s ec k, 20 10 1 5 24 8 s ita 10 4 g lip zi de m et fo rm in 7. 3 (5 6) −0 .8 − 0. 54 0. 26 (0 .1 7 to 0. 35 ) g al lw itz ,2 01 21 6 76 4 li na 10 4 g lim ep iri de m et fo rm in 7. 7 (6 1) −0 .3 8 − 0. 16 0. 22 (0 .1 6 to 0. 28 ) s ci ric e, 20 13 1 7 82 80 s ax a 10 8 p la ce bo v ar ia bl e 8. 0 (6 4) −0 .4 − 0. 3 0. 10 (0 .0 8 to 0. 26 ) w hi te ,2 01 31 8 27 01 a lo 76 p la ce bo m ul tip le 8. 0 (6 4) −0 .5 − 0. 33 0. 17 (0 .0 8 to 0. 26 ) g ok e, 20 08 1 9 30 5 v ild a 10 4 m et fo rm in n ai ve 8. 4 (6 8) −1 .0 − 1. 0 0 (− 0. 17 to 0. 17 ) r os en st oc k, 20 09 2 0 35 4 v ild a 10 4 r os ig lit az on e m et fo rm in 8. 6 (7 0) −1 .1 − 0. 82 0. 28 (0 .0 9 to 0. 47 ) w ill ia m s- h er m an , 20 10 2 1 52 s ita 10 4 m et fo rm in n on e 8. 5 (6 9) −1 .5 3 − 1. 2 0. 33 (− 0. 06 to 0. 72 ) c ha cr a, 20 11 2 2 56 s ax a 76 g ly bu rid e g ly bu rid e 8. 5 (6 9) −0 .6 4 0. 03 0. 67 (0 .5 0 to 0. 84 ) h ol la nd er ,2 01 12 3 18 6 s ax a 76 p la ce bo t hi az o 8. 4 68 ) −0 .9 4 − 1. 09 − 0. 15 (− 0. 31 to 0. 01 ) g ok e, 20 13 2 4 42 3 s ax a 10 4 g lip iz id e m et fo rm in 7. 65 (6 0) −0 .7 4 − 0. 41 0. 33 (0 .2 6 to 0. 40 ) s ix tri al s (1 9– 24 ) ar e ex te ns io n st ud ie s;
