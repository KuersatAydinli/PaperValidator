methods setting new south wales (nsw) is the most populous state in australia and houses around one-third of the country’s prisoners, or 9645 people at 31 june 2012.11 health ser- vices in nsw prisons are provided under the ministry of health, and there is a well-established prison ost pro- gramme that operates as part of the statewide opioid treatment programme.12 13 people who enter prison while in ost may continue treatment while incarcerated, and ost can be started during incarceration if clinically indicated.12 clinical indications for ost are the same as in community settings.13 most prisoners receiving ost are prescribed methadone due to the longer dosing pro- cedure associated with buprenorphine and concerns about diversion of buprenorphine. in 2012, 16% of nsw prisoners were prescribed ost.11 12 coverage of ost (the proportion of opioid-dependent prisoners receiving treatment) has been estimated at 43%.14 data sources and linkage data for this retrospective cohort study were extracted from administrative datasets used to record ost pro- grammes, offending and incarceration, and mortality. the pharmaceutical drugs of addiction system (phdas) is a database of all methadone and buprenor- phine recipients in nsw since 1985. the phdas records each patient’s full name, date of birth, gender and clinical variables including dates of ost entry and exit. identifying variables in this dataset are considered to be of high accuracy as proof of identity must be shown to the prescribing doctor before a prescription can be issued. data used for linkage were for the calen- dar years 1985–2010. offending and incarceration data were sourced from the nsw bureau of crime statistics and research (bocsar) re-offending database (rod). this database includes dates and types of offences in criminal cases heard by local, district and supreme courts of nsw, and dates of receptions to and discharges from the custody of corrective services nsw. all available data were pro- vided for linkage; this included offending data for the period 1 december 1993 to 31 december 2011 and incarceration data for the period 1 january 2000 to 31 march 2012. the national death index (ndi) is a database held by the australian institute of health and welfare (aihw), containing mortality data collected from all the registry of births, deaths and marriages in each australian state and territory. causes of death are recorded in the ndi by expert clinical coders on the basis of information contained in death certiﬁcates and, where available, coronial ﬁles, using the international statistical classiﬁcation of diseases and related health problems 10th edition (icd-10). dates of death were available for the entire period for which incarceration data were avail- able (1 january 2000 to 31 march 2012); however, for administrative reasons, causes of death were available only for deaths occurring up to 31 december 2010. linkage between the ost and offending/incarcer- ation data was performed by bocsar staff, and linkage between the ost and mortality data was undertaken by aihw staff. linkage was completed using probabilistic linkage software. variables used for matching purposes included full name, date of birth, gender, and date and state of last known contact where available. these linked datasets were forwarded to the investigators with identi- ﬁers removed. cohort and data definitions from the linked datasets, we identiﬁed a cohort of opioid-dependent people (people who were recorded in the phdas as having received ost at some point during 1986–2010) who had been incarcerated at least once (as recorded in the rod). in deﬁning receipt of ost, we excluded temporary treatment programmes (usually interstate visitors) and treatment episodes that were part of a buprenorphine clinical trial (during which the individual may have been allocated to placebo). periods in the custody of corrective services nsw were determined using reception and discharge dates in the rod. we used the ﬁrst recorded ost episode as a proxy for the onset of opioid dependence and excluded prison episodes that occurred prior to the ﬁrst ost episode; all subsequent prison episodes for an individual were included. if an individual’s ﬁrst ost episode started while incarcerated, that prison episode was included. given the chronic and relapsing nature of opioid dependence,15 16 we assumed that all cohort members remained opioid-dependent from their ﬁrst episode of ost until death or the end of follow-up. deaths in prison were deﬁned as deaths that occurred while the individual was recorded as being in the custody of corrective services nsw. this deﬁnition does not stipulate that a deceased individual was physically in prison at the time of death. some decedents may have been receiving care in hospital at the time of death, while still in the custody of corrective services nsw. deaths with known causes (ie, all deaths occurring in the calendar years 2000–2010) were categorised as natural (ie, disease-related) or unnatural deaths. we used the corrective services nsw deﬁnition of ‘unnat- ural deaths’, which includes suicides, drug-induced deaths, violent deaths and deaths due to accidental injuries or injuries in which no intent (ie, suicidal or violent) could be determined.3 icd-10 codes for unnat- ural deaths are provided in the online supplementary materials. periods of ost while in prison, and treatment status (in ost/out of ost) at the time of death, were deter- mined using treatment entry and exit dates from the phdas. new treatment episodes were deﬁned when an individual started treatment 7 or more days after dis- charge from a previous treatment episode. a change in medicine (methadone to buprenorphine, or vice versa) 2 larney s, gisev n, farrell m, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004666. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004666 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


was considered a continuous episode if there were less than 7 days between ceasing one medicine and star- tingthe other. data analysis statistical analyses were undertaken in sas v.9.3. we used descriptive statistics to examine demographic characteristics and incarceration. participants with any record of receiving ost in prison were compared with those who did not receive ost in prison using χ2 tests for categorical variables and the wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. we constructed a frequency histogram to illustrate time from entry to prison until death. for dates for which comparable data were avail- able (ﬁnancial years 2000–2001 to 2009–2010), we com- pared the total number of unnatural deaths among prisoners in nsw3 with the number of unnatural deaths in the opioid-dependent cohort. we calculated all-cause and cause-speciﬁc crude mor- tality rates (cmr) with poisson 95% ci for all time in prison and for the ﬁrst 4 weeks in prison. rates were also calculated by treatment status (in/out of ost). person-years (py) used in the calculation of cmrs accrued whenever participants were in the custody of corrective services nsw. prison episodes where the par- ticipant was received and released on the same day were counted as 1 day. py ceased to accrue at death on 31 march 2012 for all-cause mortality rates, and on 31 december 2010 for cause-speciﬁc mortality rates. cmr ratios with 95% ci were calculated to assess unadjusted risk of death in treatment compared with that out of treatment. the rate ratio (rr) was not calcu- lated if there were zero deaths in either the in-treatment or out-of-treatment condition. we used cox regression to examine the adjusted asso- ciation between ost exposure and two in-prison mortal- ity outcomes: deaths from all causes and unnatural deaths. two models were developed for each outcome: the ﬁrst considering mortality risk across all time in prison, and the second examining mortality risk during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarceration. all prison episodes were included, with days in prison counted as discon- tinuous intervals at risk. although participants could have multiple observations within the dataset, the internal computations of a cox model are such that when there is only one event of interest per person (in this case, death), there is no need for adjustments for multiple observations.17 ost exposure while in prison was coded as a time-dependent variable, with periods out of treatment coded as 0 and periods in treatment coded as 1. demographic variables included in the models were gender, indigenous (ie, aboriginal or torres strait islander) status and age at entry to prison; this latter variable increased as necessary with subse- quent incarcerations of an individual. we also included variables that described prior experiences of incarcer- ation during our observation periods, namely, the number and duration (days) of prior incarcerations. these variables increased with each incarceration per person. we also included dichotomous variables that recorded if a participant had been charged with a drug, property or violent offence prior to incarceration. these were included because of possible associations between death in prison (particularly suicide) and prior offend- ing (particularly violent offending).18 19 the offending history variables could change from no to yes with subse- quent incarcerations. observations with missing covari- ate data were excluded from the analyses. we tested each variable for its bivariate association with mortality and entered all variables into a multivariate model. we tested the proportional hazards assumption for each static predictor variable in the multivariate model by including an interaction between it and log (time) in the model. all variables in both models were found to satisfy the proportional hazards assumption. results the cohort comprised 16 715 opioid-dependent people who had been incarcerated at least once between january 2000 and march 2012 (table 1). the majority (79%; n=13 199) of the cohort was male, and 30% (n=5011) were identiﬁed as indigenous. the median age at ﬁrst entry to prison during our observation period was 30 years (ranging from 16 to 64 years). cohort members were received in prison a median of two times (ranging between 1 and 34). duration of incarceration ranged from 1 day to the entire length of follow-up (12 years and 3 months), with a median dur- ation of 71 days. most participants (76.9%; n=12 852) received ost at some point while incarcerated. compared to participants who received ost in prison, participants who did not receive ost in prison were sig- niﬁcantly older, less likely to be indigenous and have fewer incarcerations of shorter duration (table 1). deaths in prison fifty-one cohort members died in prison (table 2). most were men (90%; n=46) and non-indigenous (73%; n=37). the median age at death was 34 years (ranging between 20 and 54). only 22% (n=11) of decedents were receiving ost at the time of death. cause of death was available for 43 deaths in prison. of these, nearly three-quarters (74%; n=32) were unnatural deaths: 19 suicides, 6 drug-related deaths, 2 violent deaths and 5 deaths due to other injuries. between the ﬁnancial years 2000–2001 and 2009–2010, unnatural deaths in this cohort accounted for 35% of all unnatural deaths in nsw prisons3 (see online supplementary materials for further details). one-third of all deaths in prison (n=17) occurred during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarceration (ﬁgure 1). of these, three-quarters (13/17; 76%) were unnatural deaths: 10 suicides, 2 other injury-related deaths and 1 drug-related death. larney s, gisev n, farrell m, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004666. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004666 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


crude mortality rates the all-cause cmr in prison was 1.6/1000 py (95% ci 1.2 to 2.2/1000 py) (table 3). the all-cause cmr was sig- niﬁcantly lower while in ost (cmr: 0.7/1000 py; 95% ci 0.3 to 1.2/1000 py), compared to time out of ost (cmr: 2.7/1000 py; 95% ci 2.0 to 3.7/1000 py) (rr: 0.24; 95% ci 0.12 to 0.47). deaths from natural causes occurred at similar rates whether in (0.3/1000 py; 95% ci 0.1 to 0.8/1000 py) or out (0.5/1000 py; 95% ci 0.2 to 1/1000 py) of ost (rr: 0.68; 95% ci 0.21 to 2.21). there was, however, a marked effect of ost on rates of unnatural death. the in-treatment cmr for unnatural deaths was 0.3/1000 py (95% ci 0.1 to 0.8/1000 py), compared to 2.2/1000 py (95% ci 1.4 to 3.2/1000 py) while out of ost (rr: 0.15; 95% ci 0.06 to 0.39). of the speciﬁc unnatural causes of death, suicides were signiﬁcantly less frequent while in ost (cmr: 0.2/1000 py; 95% ci 0.04 to 0.6/ 1000 py) than while not in ost (cmr: 0.2/1000 py; 95% ci 0.04 to 0.6/1000 py) (rr: 0.15; 95% ci 0.04 to 0.52). of the six observed drug-induced deaths and ﬁve other injury deaths, none occurred during ost, but both violent deaths occurred while in ost. during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarceration, the all-cause cmr was 6.6/1000 py (95% ci 3.8 to 10.6/1000 py). of the 17 cohort members who died during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarceration, only one was receiving ost at the time of death. the in-treatment all-cause cmr in the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarceration was 0.8 deaths/1000 py (95% ci 0.02 to 4.3/1000 py), signiﬁcantly lower than the cmr of 12.7/1000 py (95% ci 7.2 to 20.6/1000 py) observed among out-of-treatment cohort members (rr: 0.06; 95% ci 0.01 to 0.45). across all time in prison, the natural mortality rate did not differ by ost status, but the in-treatment cmr for unnatural deaths (0.8/1000 py; 95% ci 0.02 to 4.4/1000 py) was signiﬁcantly lower than the out-of-treatment cmr for unnatural deaths (11/1000 py; 95% ci 5.7 to 19.2/1000 py) (rr: 0.07; table 1 demographic characteristics of opioid-dependent persons received to prison, new south wales, australia, 2000–2012 (n=16 715) characteristic total (n=16 715) ever received ost in prison (n=12 852) no ost in prison (n=3863) p value male, n (%) 13 199 (79) 10 109 (78.7) 3090 (80) 0.07 age (years) at first observed entry to prison, median (minimum–maximum) 30 (16–64) 29 (16–63) 32 (17–64) <0.0001 indigenous,* n (%) 5011 (30) 4208 (32.8) 803 (20.8) <0.0001 number of prison episodes, median (minimum–maximum) 2 (1–34) 3 (1–34) 1 (1–23) <.0001 duration (days) of prison episodes, median (minimum–maximum) 71 (1–4473) 77 (1–4473) 46 (1–4473) <0.0001 any receipt of ost in prison 12 852 (76.9) – – – *indigenous status missing for 10 individuals. p values refer to the comparison between participants who did or did not receive ost in prison (χ2 test for categorical variables; wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables). ost, opioid substitution therapy. table 2 demographic characteristics and causes of death of opioid-dependent persons who died in prison, new south wales, australia, 2000–2012 (n=51) characteristic n (%) male 46 (90) age (years) at death, median (minimum–maximum) 34 (20–54) indigenous 14 (27) in ost at time of death 11 (22) deaths from natural causes* 11 (26) unnatural deaths* 32 (74) suicide 19 (44) drug-related 6 (14) violent 2 (5) other injury-related 5 (12) *cause of death unknown for eight decedents. percentage is based on n=43. ost, opioid substitution therapy. figure 1 deaths from natural, unnatural and unknown causes, by time in prison prior to death among opioid-dependent people who died in prison, new south wales, australia, 2000–2012 (n=51). 4 larney s, gisev n, farrell m, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004666. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004666 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

in this study. as an observational study, cohort members were not randomly allocated to treatment. although there were some differences between prisoners who did and did not receive ost, these variables did not affect the association between ost and mortality. we did not have clinical indicators of current opioid dependence, and it is possible that some members of our cohort may have ceased all opioid use, thereby reducing their base- line mortality risk. however, given the chronic and relapsing nature of opioid dependence,15 16 this is unlikely to have been the case for any substantial propor- tion of the cohort. inclusion of opioid-abstinent indivi- duals would, at any rate, result in conservative mortality estimates. finally, we used the ﬁrst episode of ost as a proxy for the onset of opioid dependence. it is possible that some cohort members had previous incarcerations during which they were opioid dependent, but had not yet entered ost. to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study of its kind. prior studies have reported on all-cause or cause-speciﬁc mortality in prison among total prisoner populations.4 21 22 we have extended on these studies by analysing mortality in opioid-dependent prisoners—a group with known mortality risk factors. compared with opioid-dependent populations at liberty, mortality rates were low in opioid-dependent prisoners.10 this is most likely a result of limited access to illicit opioids and low exposure to other common causes of death in this popu- lation, such as motor vehicle accidents.23 highlighting the vulnerability of this population, however, 74% of deaths in prison were due to unnatural causes, com- pared to 48–59% of deaths in studies of total prisoner populations.2–5 the great majority of deaths occurred while prisoners were not receiving ost. although this protective effect of ost against mortality is known,10 this is the ﬁrst time that this association has been observed in a prison setting. prior studies of ost in cor- rectional settings, including a clinical trial24 and pro- spective cohort studies,25 26 have not reported any deaths during ost, but these were not powered to detect differences in mortality rates during periods in and out of treatment. receipt of ost in prison also reduces illicit opioid use and injecting drug use,24 27 and is associated with reduced institutional drug charges.28 opioid-dependent prisoners who receive ost are more likely than their untreated peers to enrol in ost following release,29 and continuation of ost on release is associated with reduced reincarceration30 and reduced postrelease mortality.31 although we have demonstrated a very strong protect- ive effect of ost against death in prison for opioid- dependent prisoners, several questions remain to be answered. this study was undertaken in a jurisdiction with relatively high ost coverage.14 our understanding of the relationship between ost and deaths in prison could beneﬁt from further observational or simulation studies that assess the impact of varying levels of ost coverage on deaths. further, this study was not able to ta bl e 4 c ox pr op or tio na lh az ar ds m od el s of pr

determine why it is that ost should be associated with reduced unnatural deaths. given that drug withdrawal symptoms have been implicated as a trigger for suicide in the ﬁrst week of prison,7 8 the association may, in part at least, be due to alleviation or prevention of opioid withdrawal. if it is the case that averting withdrawal symp- toms is sufﬁcient to prevent some prison suicides, there are important implications for the clinical management of withdrawal symptoms of prisoners dependent on non- opioid drugs. research examining why there are fewer suicides among opioid-dependent prisoners in ost is needed, as is research examining whether management of withdrawal from non-opioid drugs has a similar impact on suicides in prison. the implication of these ﬁndings for correctional authorities and prison medical providers is clear; ensur- ing a high coverage of ost in correctional settings will help to minimise unnatural deaths among opioid- dependent prisoners. given the particularly high mortal- ity risk observed during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of incarcer- ation, it is critical that opioid-dependent prisoners can access ost in a timely manner. opioid dependence and enrolment in ost immediately prior to entry to prison should be assessed during intake medical examinations. prisoners enrolled in ost prior to prison entry should be able to continue this treatment without interruption, and other opioid-dependent prisoners should be assessed for ost and offered treatment if clinically indicated. although there are challenges to the imple- mentation of ost programmes in prisons and other cor- rectional settings, these can be managed through strong executive leadership, ongoing training and education for health and custodial staff, and careful attention to issues of safety and security.32 acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge all data custodians for providing access to the datasets used in this study: the nsw ministry of health (phdas dataset), the bureau of crime statistics and research (rod dataset) and the australian institute of health and welfare (ndi dataset). they thank judy trevena for her work on the initial preparation and cleaning of datasets, pia salmelainen (nsw health) for expert advice about the phdas dataset and jacqui fitzgerald (bocsar) for advice regarding the rod. they also wish to thank the members of our indigenous reference group: michael doyle, anton clifford, megan williams and luke bell. contributors sl completed the analysis and led the writing and is responsible for the overall content as guarantor. td provided statistical advice and contributed to the writing. ng, mf, lb, ag and jk contributed to the writing. ld oversaw the larger project for which these data were obtained and contributed to the writing. funding funding for the work undertaken for this manuscript was provided by a project grant from the national health and medical research council (nhmrc) (grant no. 1005668). this project was also supported by a grant from the australian institute of criminology (aic) through the criminology research grants program. sl and ld are supported by nhmrc research fellowships (numbers 1035149 and 1041742, respectively). ld has received untied educational grants from reckitt benckiser to conductpostmarketing surveillance of the diversion and injection of opioids. mf has participated in workshops in the asia-pacific region on the development of treatment services and on research with opioid users;
