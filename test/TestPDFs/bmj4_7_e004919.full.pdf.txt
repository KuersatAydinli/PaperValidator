confounding, disadvantaged people are sorted into com- munities with multiple disadvantages such as high neigh- bourhood density and poor street connectivity.8 as illustrated by studying the effects of neighbourhood deprivation on preterm birth in us populations,2 when communities were stratiﬁed based on social factors indicat- ing deprivation, percentages of populations by race and levels of education, there were very small numbers of deprived communities with high rates of university educa- tion or with low percentages of speciﬁc races. the pres- ence of structural confounding can therefore be explored by stratifying communities according to the levels of social factors of interest and then examining the number of par- ticipants in combinations of the strata. in the case of exist- ence of structural confounding, low numbers in some combination of social strata is not a function of sample size, it is due to the ‘structure’ of the society. community social capital is typically measured by levels of social cohesion and the quality of interpersonal relationships and has been shown to vary across other sociodemographic factors such as social class and educa- tion levels.9 10 within child populations, independent associations have been reported between living in neigh- bourhoods with high levels of social capital and self- reports of improved general well-being,11 emotional adjustment12 and mental health.13 evidence surround- ing the impact of social capital on the occurrence of injuries in child populations is scarce. the few existing studies14–16 provide weak evidence on the preventive impact of social capital in occurrence of youth injuries. however, these studies all lack a well-developed and evidence-based conceptual framework and suffer from unreﬁned statistical analyses. none have explored the possibility of structural confounding effects of other community level factors. socioeconomic status (ses)15 and street connectivity,17 are each potential determinants of youth injury. injury is a common and potentially preventable health outcome in child populations. worldwide, more than 875 000 chil- dren die annually as a result of injury and non-fatal injuries are experienced by 10–30 million children and adolescents each year.18 unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for canadian children and ado- lescents from 1 to 19 years of age.19 in order to estimate the unique contribution of community social capital on youth injuries, the effects of such community factors should be controlled for in multivariate analyses, and their inﬂuence as structural confounders requires consideration. the aims of this study were (1) to describe selected individual and community level characteristics of canadian school-aged adolescents; (2) to develop and test the reliability and validity of composite scales for the measurement of social capital, ses and built environ- ment and (3) to determine the possible roles of commu- nity level ses, social capital factors, street connectivity and green space as structural confounding variables in such studies of the aetiology of youth injury. methods data sources cycle 6 (2009–2010) of the canadian hbsc is a cross- sectional survey of health behaviours and outcomes in a nationally representative sample of over 26 000 canadian students aged 11–15 years. these students came from 436 schools in 11/13 provinces and territories in canada.20 the hbsc employs a multistage cluster sampling strategy in which the sampling units are classes nested within schools, which in turn are nested in their school boards, then provinces/territories. institutionalised youth, youth in private schools, as well as those on the streets are excluded. data collection involved administration of a written, in-class questionnaire that took 45–60 min to complete, administrated from october 2009 until may 2010. the survey involves measurement of a variety of health topics including those pertinent to this study such as sociodemographic factors, self-reported occurrence of injury and indicators for interpersonal relationships.20 the 2006 canadian census data on indicators of ses such as family income, rates of employment and educa- tion were obtained from statistics canada.21 built envir- onment data were directly obtained via gis technology. units of analysis in this study, schools and their surrounding neighbour- hoods were used as the aggregate units of analysis because we were interested in assessing the effects of built environment and area ses surrounding schools on the occurrence of injuries, as opposed to residential neigh- bourhood settings. prior research also have considered the buffer around school reliable for constructs such as street types and connectivity, food environments, green space and socioeconomic environments.17 22–24 it has also been shown that in canada, many of the characteristics of the school are important contextual factors associated with youth health behaviours and outcomes.25 measures individual-level characteristics injuries were estimated based on students’ answers to a self-reported question: ‘during the past 12 months, how many times were you injured and had to be treated by a doctor or nurse?’ an ecological measure of injuries for each school was calculated by dividing the number of injured children over the total number of participants from the school. demographic variables of age, sex and individual ses were measured by direct questions. in concordance to similar studies,26 family inﬂuence as a proxy for the indi- vidual level ses was measured based on the self-rated question about material wealth: how well off do you think your family is? community-level characteristics social capital children were asked to rate their feelings about ﬁve statements using response options from strongly agree to 2 vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 open access


strongly disagree. statements were about ‘trust’ toward people around them, the possibility of asking for help or a favour from neighbours as a measure of ‘cooperation’, and three statements about ‘cohesion’. cohesion was deﬁned as the level of interpersonal relationship and availability of safe places for social interactions and spending free time. averages of individual scores were aggregated to the group (school) level as per existing precedents.27 28 socioeconomic status we wanted to estimate the area ses around each school objectively and based on previous canadian studies,29 education, employment and average income are valid indicators for community ses. we used a 1 km buffer surrounding schools based on existing precedents.23 30 31 previous research using the hbsc data has found this to be an appropriate buffer by which making meaningful inference about social constructs such as neighbour- hood ses is possible.23 using census-based measures, education was deﬁned according to the proportion of people (15+years) with at least a high school diploma and the employment ratio was deﬁned as the proportion of people older than 25 who were employed. we also obtained the average family income for each buffer. built environment built environment indicators of street connectivity and green space were measured directly by employing gis techniques for the same 1 km circular buffer, again as per existing precedents31; 1 km circular provides similar results (not identical) in measuring built environment factors when compared to road-network buffers22 and 5 km circular buffers17 and therefore is an adequate buffer for our purpose. green space was deﬁned as the proportion of land areas of parks, ﬁelds and wooden area relative to the total land area. intersection density (number of intersections within the circular buffer divided by total area), average block length (sum length of roads within the buffer divided by number of real nodes), and connected node ratio (number of real nodes divided by all types of nodes such as intersections, dead-ends and cul-de-sacs) were used as indicators of street connectivity, as per existing precedents.17 green space and street connectivity were viewed as separate built environment constructs. analyses descriptive key variables of interest were described at individual and community levels. distributions of variables across differ- ent social capital groups were estimated and compared using analysis of variance and χ2 tests. development of composite scales and testing their reliability and validity exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analyses were per- formed to assess the psychometric properties of composite scales describing community social capital, ses and street connectivity. the robustness of the exploratory factor analysis was assessed by estimating diag- nostic measure of sampling adequacy (the kaiser-meyer-olkin measure) and by bartlett’s test of sphericity. cronbach α levels for internal consistency were calculated as indicator of reliability.32 in order to provide a more rigorous assessment of the factorial struc- ture and the validity of the derived scales, they were sub- jected to conﬁrmatory factor analyses (cfa). model ﬁt was tested using the comparative ﬁt index (cfi) and the tucker-lewis index (tli)33 34 which ﬁndings of 0.95 or more were considered to indicate adequate ﬁt.35 the root mean square error of approximation (rmsea) and standardised root mean square residual (srmr) were used to estimate how well the model will reproduce the population covariance, with values less than 0.08 indicat- ing a good ﬁt.34 the composite scale for social capital was deﬁned as the sum scores of each item with the corresponding weights guided by loadings obtained from the factor analyses. to construct a composite scale for community ses, each of 419 schools was ﬁrst ranked based on each of the three ses indicators. the schools were divided into tertiles and then were scored from 1 to 3 according to their tertiles. an additive composite scale for the ses was constructed including the scores of three indicators with the same weights. similar methods were employed for constructing a composite scale for street connectivity. since there are no meaningful cut-off points for our constructed composite scales of social capital, ses and street connectivity, we categorised them using quantiles for analytic purposes as per existing precedents.17 29 the ranges of composite scales were narrow (3–9 for ses and street connectivity; 5–25 for social capital) therefore we chose tertiles versus quartile or quintile29 for categorisation. structural confounding stratiﬁed tabulations2 were the main analytic tool for exploring structural confounding. total number of stu- dents and number of occurrence of injuries in each combination of strata of community ses, built environ- ment and social capital were estimated. according to the theories of structural confounding,1–5 non-existence or low numbers of students in extreme cells is suggestive of strong social stratiﬁcation and possible structural con- founding. we deﬁned extreme cells as combinations of ‘good’ ses and ‘good’ social capital (highest tertile) but ‘poor’ built environment (lowest tertile), or combination of ‘low’ ses and low’ social capital but ‘good’ built envir- onment. there is no established low number to represent the existence of structural confounding. a standard low number might vary based on the context of the study and sample size. for example, messer et al2 in their study of neighbourhoods of two counties in north carolina with a sample size of 31 715 considered fewer than 30 in each cell as evidence for structural vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 3 open access


confounding. we did not set any number representing ‘low number’ a priori. the jonckheere-terpstra test36 37 was used to establish if there were gradients in number of students by ordered groups of social factors. this is a sensitive non-parametric trend test for ordered differences among ordered groups, in which the null suggests that the distribution of the response variable does not differ across groups. all ana- lyses were conducted using sas v.9.3 (sas institute inc, cary, north carolina, usa) and mplus v.5.21.38 results sample description table 1 demonstrates the distribution of individual and community level characteristics of the study population. from the total sample size of 26 078 students, 2546 indi- viduals did not answer the social capital questions. mean age (sd) of the participants was 14.2 (1.5), 48% were males, and 14.6% reported a non-sport-related injury in the last 12 months. as expected, injury rates in males were higher compared to females (15.4 vs 12.9. p<0.0001). basic sociodemographic characteristics and frequencies of injuries were not signiﬁcantly different between those who responded to the social capital ques- tions and those who did not (see online supplementary appendix table 1). census data for ses indicators at the 1 km buffer were available for 419 of the schools. the average family income for the entire sample was $76 015 (sd=$23 769), with suggestion of a normal distribution except for a number of outliers in high-income brackets. mean pro- portions of people with more than high school educa- tion and with employment were 62% and 72%, respectively (table 1). street connectivity indicators were available for most buffers, although green space data for 115 schools (27%) were unavailable due to lack of imaging. this occurred particularly in very remote areas of canada such as in nunavut and northwest territories where the main land area contains little vegetation and was mainly open space covered with clay, permafrost, rock, gravel and water and remote rural areas where there is mainly agricultural land. normal distributions observed for the ses and street connectivity indicators satisﬁed the main assumptions for factor analysis. table 1 distribution of individual and community level characteristics in the total study population and by community social capital (sc) status total high sc (n=143) medium sc (n=140) low sc (n=136) p value* individual level characteristics number of student 23 532 7799 8389 7344 age (mean, sd) 14.2 (1.5) 13.9 (1.5) 14.2 (1.5) 14.3 (1.5) <0.0001 per cent male 48.17 49.3 47.6 47.7 0.06 number of injured (%) 3449 (14.7) 1142 (14.6) 1221 (14.6) 1086 (14.8) 0.92 family affluence (%) <0.0001 well off 12 598(53.6) 3891 (49.9) 4544 (54.2) 4163 (56.7) average 7978 (33.9) 2871 (36.8) 2828 (33.7) 2279 (31) not well off 2223 (9.4) 827 (10.6) 778 (9.3) 613 (8.4) missing 733 (3.1) 210 (2.7) 239 (2.8) 284 (3.9) community level characteristics† socioeconomic status indicators average income $ (mean, sd) 76 015 (23 768) 78 115(29 820) 76 553 (18 625) 73 215 (21 063) 0.21 employed (mean proportion, sd) 0.62 (0.11) 0.61 (0.11) 0.63 (0.11) 0.63 (0.11) 0.19 high school diploma and higher (mean proportion, sd) 0.72 (0.13) 0.73 (0.13) 0.73 (0.12) 0.69 (0.14) 0.02 ses composite index 6 (2.1) 6.2 (2.1) 6.4 (2.1) 5.7 (1.9) 0.04‡ built environment characteristics intersection density (mean, sd) 40.6 (29.2) 40.6 (37.9) 38.4 (19.8) 42.9 (26.5) 0.43 average block length (mean, sd) 283 (230) 308 (329) 278 (187) 262 (113) 0.23 connected nodes ratio (mean, sd) 0.83 (0.10) 0.82 (0.10) 0.82 (0.11) 0.85 (0.09) 0.05 street connectivity composite index (mean, sd) 6.0 (2.0) 5.9 (1.9) 5.8 (2.0) 6.3 (2.0) 0.07 green space (mean, sd) 0.14 (0.14) 0.138 (0.14) 0.14 (0.14) 0.139 (0.13) 0.99 population health status average rates of injuries 0.14 (0.06) 0.14 (0.07) 0.14 (0.06) 0.13 (0.06) 0.39 *comparing social capital groups by analysis of variance and χ2 test when appropriate. †at 1 km buffer of schools. ‡low sc group significantly different from medium sc group (boneferroni multiple comparison test). 4 vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 open access


development and testing the reliability and the validity of composite scales exploratory factor analysis of social capital items indi- cated high and similar loadings for all included items, and a relatively high internal consistency (cronbach’s-α= 0.76; ﬁgure 1). the statistical signiﬁcance of bartlett’s test suggested that one factor was sufﬁcient to explain the correlations. the kaiser-meyer-olkin (kmo) measure of sampling adequacy was higher than 0.60 (0.79) which is tolerable and suggested that the dataset was appropriate for a factor analysis.39 the conﬁrmatory factor analysis indicated a good ﬁt model, with a cfi of 0.968, a tli of 0.974, a rmesa of 0.084 (95% ci 0.080 to 0.089) and a srmr of 0.026.33 34 owing to relatively similar loadings, all items were given the same weight in constructing the composite scale. the developed composite scales for ses and street connectivity were also reliable and valid. both scales showed good internal consistency (cronbach’s-α of 0.74 and 0.70, respectively), acceptable kmo, and a signiﬁ- cant bartlett’s test, which supported the appropriateness of the data and adequacy of the one factor solution (ﬁgure 2). conﬁrmatory factor analyses basically indi- cated a perfect ﬁt (cfi=1, tli=1, rmsea=0.0, srmr=0.0) for both indices. variations across levels of community social capital students living in schools with lower social capital were signiﬁcantly older, more often female and less likely to live in families with average levels of afﬂuence (table 1). furthermore, schools with lower social capital were located in communities with signiﬁcantly lower levels of education. compared to areas with low social capital, average family income in high social capital areas was higher by 6.3% (p=0.21) and the composite index of community ses was signiﬁcantly lower in schools with low social capital compared to those with medium social capital (5.7 vs 6.4; p=0.04). the differences between social capital levels for the proportion of area with green space was less than 1% (p=0.99) and for street connectivity was 7.9% (p=0.07). structural confounding tabulation analyses (tables 2 and 3) showed that there were no strong social sorting mechanisms at work for community levels of social capital, ses and built envir- onment factors (either measured as street connectivity or as green space). we therefore observed no structural confounding effects. student populations and injured cases were observed in all combination of strata of our three community measures and none of so-called extreme cells (deﬁned above in methods) were empty or with sparse numbers of observation. this is indicative of potential absence of structural confounding and segre- gation in our population of canadian youth. all cells contained the outcome and future multivariate regres- sion analyses should be based on actual observed data not ‘off-support’ and ‘smoothed over’ cells.1 we also per- formed the same tabulation analysis stratiﬁed by sexes. unsurprisingly, the occurrence of injuries was more fre- quent among boys but applying the same methodology showed no evidence of structural confounding neither in boys nor in girls (data not shown). the jonckheere-terpstra tests showed that signiﬁcantly more students went to schools surrounded by poor street connectivity and poor green space. this was observed in all levels of community social capital, however was more pronounced in high social capital communities (tables 2 and 3). figure 1 confirmatory factor analysis of the social capital measure. vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 5 open access


discussion in this study of structural confounding in adolescent canadian populations, we chose to study three social and environmental factors of social capital, ses and built environment which have been shown to be poten- tial risk factors for injuries in adolescents.15 17 all items used to develop composite scales for social capital, ses and street connectivity had been employed in similar studies previously8 15 17 31 but since validity is about the attributes of the people who are assessed not the inher- ent characteristics of the scale32 we revalidated all scales for our population. we employed three items of educa- tion, employment and income which were previously identiﬁed as the material deprivation indicators among canadian population29 as measures for community ses. satisfactory results of exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analyses showed that these measures are reliable and valid indicators for community ses in the study population. age of 15 might not be the best cut-off point for measuring levels of education since people usually graduate from high school at the age of 18 or 19, however we were constrained to the use of aggregated census data provided by statistics canada. nevertheless, our objective was to compare ses across schools and since the education measure was used uniformly across all schools the ‘not optimal’ age cut-off is not likely to produce any bias in our results. the street connectivity composite scale based on intersection density, average block length and connected node ratio in a 1 km radius around each school has been used in similar studies8 17 but was never validated. we therefore re-examined this scale in our analysis and it indicated a perfect ﬁt. we constructed the social capital composite scale based on the scale development methodology suggested figure 2 confirmatory factor analysis of socioeconomic status and street connectivity measures. table 2 numbers of students and rates of injuries in each combination of social capital, ses and street connectivity high social capital medium social capital low cocial capital street connectivity street connectivity street connectivity ses good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries high 487* 87* 575 79 1082† 176 407† 69‡ 845 135 846 121 509‡ 89 477 65 816† 116 medium 219 38 782 112 2317 347 1211 176 1248 198 1207 192 840 143 794 128 931 138 low 795† 132 571 101 810 129 970 164 572 89 911 135 498† 85 1227 236 1069 136 *p of the jonckheere-terpstra test <0.0001. †extreme cells (high ses and social capital but poor street connectivity or low ses and social capital but good street connectivity). ‡p of the jonckheere-terpstra test <0.05. ses, socioeconomic status. 6 vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 open access


by streiner.32 first, in order to have appropriate content validity,28 three main domains of social capital (cohe- sion, cooperation and trust) were measured by ﬁve ques- tions in the hbsc survey. then, by exploratory factor analysis we evaluated the factor structure of these domains and demonstrated that all domains loaded onto a single underlying factor. cronbach-α of 0.76 for the ﬁve-item scale shows proper internal consistency (larger than 0.70)32 and also being smaller than 0.90 was indicative of no item redundancy.40 high loadings of all of these ﬁve items showed that the items tap into the hypothetical construct of social capital32 and thus our scale has good construct validity which was further con- ﬁrmed by acceptable model ﬁt indices calculated by the conﬁrmatory factor analysis. in tabulation analyses, we found no evidence for the presence of structural confounding in the study popula- tion. all cells in our tabulation analyses contained data. this is a true indication of absence of structural con- founding, not an artefact, due to our large sample size. a study performed by messer2 showed that in the socially stratiﬁed context of neighbourhoods of north carolina, even with a large sample size of 31 715 there will be no people in extreme cells. she showed that literally no white woman lived in the most deprived areas and no black woman lived in privileged neighbourhoods. our results showed that in canada, there are fewer multiple social disadvantages and there are economically poor communities with good built environment or with high social capital. statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings from the jonckheere-terpstra tests suggest that there is a trend in number of students according to levels ses and built environment factors. in all subgroups of social capital, it is more likely for students to go to school located in poor ses and unfavourable built environment communities, in other words, low ses and poor built environment com- munities are signiﬁcantly more populous. our ﬁndings contrasted with those from similar studies which mostly have been performed in the usa.2 8 this absence of structural confounding in canadian youth populations has several potential explanations. structural confounding from community social factors occurs more often in countries with higher levels of social stratiﬁcation such as in the usa.1 compared to the usa, factors creat- ing social segregation such as income inequality are weaker in canada.41 42 we also did not stratify schools based on rural–urban status. rural communities can enjoy high levels of social capital but at the same time suffer from poor built environment and low levels of ses. it is plausible that some of the schools with high social capital and low built environment are located in rural areas. another reason for our null results may be due to our choice of aggregation. schools may represent insufﬁ- ciently reﬁned geographical units to observe any mean- ingful variation across ses strata. limitations of this study warrant comment. perfect ﬁt of factor analysis models for ses and street connectivity can be of concern. it is possible that in conﬁrmatory factor analysis models with small number of items lack of sufﬁcient variations results in a saturated model with perfect ﬁt33; one interpretation is that the model is not reliable. we also made more parsimonious models (with only two items) and they also showed perfect ﬁts. our inability to fully consider the size of populations of com- munities is another limitation. inequalities are at highest in large cities, separate analysis for large metropolitan areas might show different results and possible structural confounding within big cities. our sample excluded certain groups of youth, mainly institutionalised indivi- duals, those who live on the streets, and private schools. we were interested in studying community-related factors, and the exclusion of the ﬁrst two groups who do not live in communities is not a problem for our study. however, exclusion of private school students is a potential threat to external generalisability of our results but since only 5% of students in canada go to private schools, and less than 2% are in other types of situations (http://www. statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-595-m/2013099/tbl/tbl1.1-eng. htm), this limitation is unlikely to produce considerable bias. another threat to representativeness of our results is table 3 numbers of students and injuries in each combination of social capital, ses and green space high social capital medium social capital low social capital green space green space green space ses good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries good students number of injuries average students number of injuries poor students number of injuries high 459* 755 232† 697* 533 349 604* 330 348† 67* 115 38 118* 78 49 85 43 62 medium 850 1201 1002 1031 1369 899 842 269 826 118 157 176 129 234 146 127 45 129 low 358† 215 1334 538 609 1132 531† 1141 704 45 43 232 86 87 182 101 189 102 *p of the jonckheere-terpstra test <0.0001. †extreme cells (high ses and social capital but poor green space or low ses and social capital but good green space). ‡p of the jonckheere-terpstra test <0.05. ses, socioeconomic status. vafaei a, pickett w, alvarado be. bmj open 2014;4:e004919. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004919 7 open access


the high percentage (27% of schools) of missing data for green space. these missing data were not random and were in very remote and rural areas where due to the characteristics of the environment (being mostly agricul- tural or non-vegetation) ‘green space’ is undeﬁnable. our results may not be generalisable to these areas. in conclusion, in this study of school age canadian students we addressed two major methodological issues of social epidemiological research: the validity of com- posite community level measures and the possibility of structural confounding. we showed our composite mea- sures for social capital, ses and built environment are valid and also there is no evidence of structural con- founding in our data. the aetiological analysis, that is, explaining factors contributing to variations in injury rates was not a purpose of this study. owing to the non- existence of structural confounding in this population the independent effect of each community factor on occurrence of injuries, to be explored in subsequent multilevel multivariate analyses, can be estimated free of this major limitation of social epidemiological studies. however, more studies are needed to explore the exist- ence of structural confounding in other populations and with different outcomes. acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the international databank manager dr oddrun samdal, university of bergen, norway. the canadian principal investigators of hbsc dr john freeman and dr william pickett, queen’s university, and its national coordinator is matthew king. the authors also thank mr andrei rosu for contributions in the gis data collection. contributors av developed the theoretical framework, performed the literature review, designed and conducted the statistical analyses. bea and wp provided methodological and editorial supervision and guidance all through the study and contributed to the final manuscript. funding the public health agency of canada and health canada funded cycle 6 of the health behaviour in school-aged children survey in canada. additional support for this analysis included an operating grant from the canadian institutes of health research and the heart and stroke foundation of canada (mop 97962;
