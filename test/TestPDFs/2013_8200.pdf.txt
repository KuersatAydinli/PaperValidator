   3 abstract:  background: perineal trauma during childbirth affects millions of women  worldwide every year. the aim of the perineal assessment and repair  longitudinal study (pearls) was to improve maternal clinical outcomes  following childbirth through an enhanced cascaded multi-professional training  programme to support implementation of evidence based perineal  management.     methods:  design: a pragmatic matched pair cluster randomised controlled trial.   participants: women (n=3681) sustaining a second-degree perineal tear in  one of 22 uk maternity units (clusters) organised in 11 matched pairs.  intervention: units in each matched pair were randomised to receive the  training intervention either early (group a) or late (group b).   main outcome measures: outcomes within each cluster were assessed prior  to any training intervention (phase 1), and then after group a (phase 2) and  after group b (phase 3) received the training intervention.  focusing on phase  2, the primary outcome was percentage of women with pain on sitting or  walking at 10-12 days postnatal. secondary outcomes included use of pain  relief at 10-12 days postnatal, need for suture removal, uptake and duration of  exclusive breastfeeding, and perineal wound infection. practice based  measures included implementation of evidence into practice to promote  effective clinical management of perineal trauma.   analysis: cluster level paired t-tests were used to compare groups a and b.   


   4 results:  there was no significant difference between clusters in phase 2 of  the study in the average percentage of women reporting perineal pain on  sitting and walking at 10 – 12 days (mean difference 0.7% 95% ci (-10.1%,  11.4%), p=0.89). the intervention significantly improved over-all use of  evidence-based practice in the clinical management of perineal trauma. there  was a significant reduction in mean percentages of women reporting perineal  wound infections and women needing sutures removed in clusters following  the training intervention.    conclusion: pearls is the first rct to assess the impact of a ‘training  package on implementation of evidence based perineal trauma management.  the intervention did not significantly improve our primary outcome but  significantly improved evidence based practice and some relevant secondary  clinical outcomes for women.     trial registry: isrctn - 28960026 and nihr ukcrn - 4785                   


   5 background:  around 85% of women who have a vaginal birth sustain perineal trauma,  either spontaneously or as a consequence of an episiotomy, and three- quarters of these women will require suturing to facilitate healing of the  disrupted tissue1. perineal trauma related symptoms, particularly if they  persist, can negatively impact on a woman’s physical ability to mobilise and  hinders recovery postnatally 2-4.  evidence of how maternal morbidity arising from perineal trauma could be  reduced shorter-term is already available. cochrane systematic reviews have  consistently demonstrated that the continuous suturing of the vagina, perineal  muscles and skin using absorbable synthetic suture materials is associated  with less perineal pain and less requirement for analgesia5-7. moreover,  rapidly absorbable synthetic sutures were less likely to be associated with the  need to remove suture materials postnatally. therefore, there has been high  level evidence recommending the use of fast absorbable suture material for  the repair of second degree perineal trauma and episiotomy using the  continuous suturing technique whenever feasible. this evidence is  incorporated into national clinical guidelines informing routine clinical care 8 9.       in the uk trained midwives are responsible for the care of women during  normal vaginal births and they also undertake any related perineal  assessments and repairs. obstetricians tend to be involved if the perineal  trauma is deemed to be complex, more than a second degree tear or as part  of an operative vaginal birth. as part of the preliminary work for the perineal  assessment and repair longitudinal study (pearls), the study team 


   6 conducted a comprehensive baseline national survey of a representative  sample of midwives in clinical practice. the survey highlighted inadequate  implementation of evidence into practice in relation to the management of  childbirth-related perineal trauma where only 6% of the midwives used the  recommended evidence based suturing technique. moreover, participants  highlighted that one of the main reasons for this gap was related to training 10.     pearls formed the main part of a national clinical quality improvement (qi)  project. the aim of the perineal assessment and repair longitudinal study  (pearls) was to improve maternal clinical outcomes following childbirth  through an enhanced cascaded multi-professional training programme to  support implementation of evidence based perineal management.       methods:  the study received favourable ethical approval (pearls rec reference -  07/mre 12/2, isrctn - 28960026 and nihr ukcrn - 4785). pearls was  conducted according to the published study protocol 11.    participants  it was our intention to test the effectiveness of a qi intervention in increasing  the implementation of evidence-based perineal assessment and repair  guidance by midwives and obstetricians involved in the provision of  intrapartum and postpartum care within the hospital and in the community.  to  minimise contamination, we used a randomised cluster design where the unit 


   7 of randomization and analysis was the maternity unit.    the study groups comprised of 11 matched maternity unit pairs where units  (clusters) within a matched pair, were randomly allocated to receive the qi  intervention either early (cluster a) or late (cluster b) in the study period. to  ensure generalizability of findings it was important that the study reflected  differences in workload, staffing levels and demographics of women using the  service between the different models of maternity care.  an open invitation to  participate in the qi project was sent nationally, via the royal college of  midwives (rcm), to heads of midwifery (homs) who have responsibility for  the management of midwifery services in the uk.  those expressing interest  were requested to provide information relating to their population  demographics, birth rates and current perineal care and training provision.  twenty-four nhs units expressed an interest to participate, however one unit  was subsequently excluded because of a delay in providing information  required for matching. the 11 matched pairs required for the study were  selected from the remaining 23 units.     women booked to give birth in participating units were informed of the study  during the antenatal period and additional information was made available, if  requested. in line with the ethics committee’s request and to maintain  women’s autonomy in deciding whether they wished to be sent study  questionnaires and their data used in study analyses, women were only  included if they provided valid written consent to participate. following birth,  women who sustained a second-degree perineal tear or episiotomy were 


   8 eligible unless they were < 16 years of age, non-english speaking or had  suffered a pregnancy loss. informed consent was obtained prior to discharge  home.  women who consented had information on their parity, type of vaginal  birth, and methods and materials used for repair of their perineal trauma,  entered by the recruiting clinician (either a midwife or an obstetrician) on a  trial data entry sheet. women were provided with a study pack containing a  covering letter, 10-12 day questionnaire and pre-paid reply envelope.  the  woman’s general practitioner (family doctor) was informed about her  participation in the study. women who returned the 10-12 day questionnaire  received a second questionnaire and pre-paid return envelope at three  months postpartum.     intervention:  the pearls-qi intervention was an interactive multi-professional education  package aimed at enhancing the knowledge and clinical skills of midwives  and obstetricians to implement evidence based assessment and management  of second-degree perineal tears and episiotomy (box 1).    the intervention was implemented and cascaded within participating units by  a locally appointed pearls facilitator in each cluster. facilitators attended a  ‘train-the-trainers’ two-day workshop organised by the pearls team. to  minimise risk of contamination, the study team held two separate workshops,  with study facilitators invited to attend one of these depending on whether  their unit was randomised to receive the intervention early or late (groups a  and b) respectively. as this was a pragmatic study, facilitator’s could decide 


   9 how they organised implementation of the pearls-qi intervention within  their units, with ongoing advisory support from the trial team.     data collection:  data were collected at three time points. baseline demographic and obstetric  data were collected prior to implementing the intervention (phase 1)..  main  trial data were collected following implementation of the pearls-qi  intervention in clusters randomised to receive it early compared to the  matched clusters, which did not receive it (phase 2).  to assess sustainability  of the effects of the pearls-qi intervention, data were then collected  following implementation of the intervention in the other cluster in the matched  pair (phase 3). each woman recruited had a study entry form completed by a  clinician and was sent a self-complete questionnaire at 10-12 days and three  months postnatal.  a period of three months was allowed for the pearls-qi  intervention to be cascaded in all clusters. recruitment duration varied  between matched cluster pairs depending on the size of the cluster.    primary outcome:  based on the findings of cochrane reviews related to suturing techniques and  materials for perineal repair, the use of evidence based suture techniques and  materials was associated with a significant reduction in perineal pain on  walking or sitting within the past 24 hours as measured at 10-12 days  postnatally using a four item scale ranging from ‘none’ to ‘severe’ 7 12.   therefore this was selected as the primary outcome for the study.    


   10 secondary outcomes  our secondary oucomes were selected from those commonly reported in  previous perineal trauma management studies and relevant cochrane  reviews 5 12. to ensure a woman-centred focus on quality improvement was  maintained, delphi surveys of independent service user groups were  undertaken to identify patient reported outcomes (proms) considered  most  important by women who had recently experienced perineal trauma 13.  we assessed several clinical outcomes including perineal wound infection,  need for suture removal, use of pain relief during the previous 24 hours, and  breastfeeding rates at 10 – 12  days  postnatal. at three months postnatal we  collected data on women’s edinburgh postnatal depression scale (epds)  scores, if sexual intercourse had been resumed by nine weeks postnatal,  women reported poor wound healing and breast feeding rates. completed  questionnaires were returned to the pearls central office.     practice outcomes  the impact of the pearls-qi intervention on use of evidence based perineal  assessment and management was evaluated, in particular whether clinicians  used continuous non-locking suturing for the vaginal wall and muscle layer,  subcuticular suturing for the perineal skin, fast absorbable polyglactin sutures5  7 12 and whether the  woman received an information leaflet advising on  postnatal care of her perineal wound 14. this was assessed using information  provided in the study entry sheets.     sample size: 


   11 in a clustered design the effect of clustering needs to be factored into the  sample size calculation by means of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient  (icc)15. a preliminary sample size calculation was conducted prior to the start  of data collection, but was refined using data from phase 1 prior to the  commencement of phase 2. the sample size calculation for phase 2 of the  trial, when only one group of units had received the qi-intervention, assumed  that at 10 - 12 days 75% of women in the control clusters have any pain whilst  walking or sitting in the previous 24 hours (primary clinical outcome), the icc  is 0.013, a 1% significance level, and a cluster size of 40. with 16 clusters (8  pairs) this would give the study 95% power to detect a 20% reduction in  primary outcome from 75% to 55%6.  this calculation assumed no benefit in  power arising from the matched pairs design. assuming a response rate of  60% at 10-12 days implied recruiting 67 women in each cluster. the  additional clusters (11 matched pairs) in pearls would preserve the sample  size should any clusters have withdrawn from the study.    matching, randomization and allocation concealment:  once participating units were identified, matching of paired clusters and  simple randomisation was undertaken at cardiff university by a researcher  involved in designing but not running the study or analysis of data generated  from it. the statistician responsible for matching and randomization was blind  to any identifiable information about participating units. moreover, participating  units were blind to the identity of the unit they were matched to. matching  criteria included type of maternity unit (obstetric or midwifery led), number of  births per annum, availability of a perineal repair guideline, provision of 


   12 perineal repair training and availability of postnatal perineal care information  for women. intervention allocation was based on clusters rather than  individuals.     data management  a data entry company manually entered all data into a specialist data entry  software (snap™)16. to assure quality, completed questionnaires were  separated into batches prior to entry, allowing individual accountability to be  assigned for each questionnaire.  initial data entry and verification was  subsequently validated with at least 10% of questionnaires being checked.  any errors identified resulted in the whole batch and at least two subsequent  batches to be fully checked.     statistical methods  the main data analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistics version 19  17. prior to analysis data were checked statistically for outlying values and  logical inconsistencies. where data from the entry details questionnaire were  missing or needed to be checked, unit facilitators were contacted and  additions or corrections entered onto the databases. the three sets of  questionnaires (entry details, 10-12 day and three month) were matched  within each of the study phases. a preliminary data analysis plan was  published prior to the completion of data collection11. this was subsequently  refined by the central project team and agreed by the project steering group.  analysis was by ‘intention to treat’. no imputation methods were used. a 5%  2-sided significance level was used. the main analysis of the primary and 


   13 secondary outcomes was conducted by means of a cluster level analysis  focusing on phase 2 data as specified in the protocol 11. thus the unit of  analysis for the comparison between early and late intervention is the cluster  (maternity unit) rather than the individual women, reflecting the fact that the  maternity unit was the unit of randomisation, and the intervention was  delivered to maternity units. in this way any clustering effects (women in the  same maternity unit tending to be more similar to each other than to women  from other units) are taken into account.    summary statistics for outcome measures were calculated for each maternity  unit and compared between matched intervention and control clusters using  the paired t-test (with 10 degrees of freedom unless otherwise stated). for  example, the proportion of women with pain when walking or sitting in the past  24 hours was calculated as the summary statistic for each cluster.  the mean  difference in the summary statistic was then compared between intervention  and control clusters using the paired t-test, to enable the matched cluster  design to be taken into account 18 19. if the difference in summary statistics  between clusters was highly skewed, the wilcoxon signed ranks test was  used instead of the paired t-test. slight discrepancies between summary  statistics calculated from cluster level data and summary statistics calculated  from individual level data may arise because of variations in cluster size. this  method of data analysis was a protocol change where matched-pair random  effects models using mlwin software was planned20. this was because of  later concerns about estimating between cluster variability within each cluster  pair with a relatively small number of matched clusters. moreover, small  numbers of women experiencing some of the outcome measures resulted in 


   14 lack of convergence in those statistical models. where models could be run,  the paired t-test method tended to be conservative, and all statistically  significant results using the paired t-test method were also significant using  the random effects model (data not shown). maintenance of the effect of the  intervention in phase 3 was tested by comparing results from phase 3 for  group a clusters (9-12 months following implementation of the pearls-qi  intervention) to the results from phase 2 for group b clusters (when they had  not received pearls-qi intervention) using paired t-tests. this method,  which still takes into account the randomised nature of the study, was used  because group b clusters had received the intervention by the time phase 3  outcomes were collected.      results:  the results are based on data from comparison of the 11 matched paired  clusters randomly allocated to receiving the pearls-qi intervention either  early or late in the study period (phase 2). the flow of women and clusters  through the study is shown in figure 1. a total of 3681 women were recruited  with 1470 and 2211 women in group a and group b clusters respectively.  based on figures of study eligible women during phase 2, the overall  recruitment rate was 45% (36% for group a clusters and 51% for group b  clusters).   summaries of the demographic and obstetric characteristics,  reported in phase 2 are presented in table 1. in both groups combined, a total  of 85 women (5.8%) did not meet study inclusion criteria for degree of  perineal trauma. one possible explanation is variation in classification of  degree of trauma between the clinician conducting the initial examination and 


   15 the clinician undertaking the repair. being a pragmatic rct based on  intention to treat, a decision was made to include data from these women.    summary results of clinicians’ adherence to evidence based practice and  women’s reported outcomes in group a and group b clusters for the three  study phases are presented in tables 2 and 3.    there were no statistically significant differences between group a and group  b clusters with regards to pain on walking or sitting (the primary outcome  measure), need for pain relief or breast feeding rates at 10-12 days postnatal.  there was a significant reduction in average reported rates of wound infection  (p=0.03) and need for suture removal (p=0.03) in group a clusters (table 4).  there was no significant difference in any of the women’s reported outcomes  at three months postnatal.   there were differences in implementation of evidence-based practice. in the  trial comparison (phase 2) there was an improvement in adherence to  evidence based management of perineal trauma in group a clusters  compared to group b clusters. this difference was statistically significant for  use of the continuous technique to repair vaginal skin (p=0.007), perineal  muscles (p=0.04) and number of perineal repairs where the continuous  suturing technique was used throughout the repair (p=0.045). women in  group a clusters were also significantly more likely to receive information  about postnatal management of their perineal wounds (p<0.001) (table 5).  to assess the sustainability of the pearls-qi intervention, women’s reported  outcomes and use of evidence based perineal trauma management 


   16 approaches were compared between group a clusters in phase 3 (9-12  months after delivering the pearls-qi intervention) and group b clusters in  phase 2 (before the delivery of the pearls-qi intervention). there was no  statistically significant difference between both groups in any of the assessed  outcomes except for number of women receiving information leaflets on  postnatal  management of their perineal wounds (p=0.003) (table 6).     discussion:  the institute of medicine defines quality as the degree to which health  services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired  health outcomes, consistent with current professional knowledge 21.   pearls-qi assessed the effectiveness of implementation of an evidence  based standardised multi-professional training package, using a matched pair  cluster rct, on women’s health outcomes and content of clinical practice.  the gap between the availability of evidence and its implementation in relation  to the management of perineal trauma following childbirth was highlighted in a  national survey of midwives conducted by our team prior to designing the  pearls-qi intervention 10. this gap was also demonstrated in phase 1 of the  study where, prior to delivering the qi intervention in any units, only 35.8%  and 56.5% of women had perineal repairs carried out using the recommended  technique in group a and b clusters respectively. interestingly, there was a  significant improvement in the use of the continuous suturing technique for  perineal repair in group a clusters (from 35.8% to 72.5%) after delivering the  training intervention. following the delivery of the intervention in group b  clusters in phase 3 of the study, the use of evidence based techniques also 


   17 significantly improved. however, the improvements in group a clusters were  not sustained to the level achieved in phase 2, although this was still better  than the baseline level in phase 1 (tables 2, 3 and 6). despite low rates of  use of the continuous suturing technique prior to the pearls-qi intervention,  most clinicians used the recommended more rapidly absorbed polyglactin  suture material12.12. this is probably due to the fact that purchase and use of  suture material tends to be decided at an organisational rather than individual  clinician level. however, the potential benefits to maternal health, which may  accrue from the use of appropriate suturing material, are likely to be  dissipated by using less effective perineal suturing techniques. current  evidence supports the use of a continuous non-locking technique for perineal  repair over interrupted suturing particularly in relation to perineal pain at 10-12  days postnatal 5. in spite of an improvement in the use of the recommended  suturing technique, we were unable to demonstrate a reduction in women’s  reported pain outcomes. it is possible that this was due to the fact that a high  percentage of women in both groups (a and b) had subcutaneous sutures  inserted to close the perineal skin even prior to delivering the qi intervention.  indeed, this technique of skin closure appears to be associated with a  reduction in reported perineal pain 7. nevertheless, there was a significant  reduction in rates of perineal wound infection in group a compared to group  b clusters at the end of phase 2. wound infection was the outcome of most  importance for women in the delphi survey we conducted during the initial  project development. genital tract sepsis was the commonest cause of direct  maternal death in the uk during 2006 - 2008 22. sepsis is a complex and  poorly understood cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and highlights 


   18 the importance of effective care to minimise infection and need to increase  awareness of sepsis among women and clinicians.     to our knowledge pearls is the first rct to test a qi intervention  specifically developed to improve use of evidence-based assessment and  management of birth related perineal trauma to reduce maternal morbidity.  it  is the largest study to date to evaluate the impact of use of evidence based  perineal repair methods on women’s postnatal health. a major strength of the  study design was including a long-term assessment phase to measure  sustainability of the intervention. it seems that implementation of the  intervention changed clinical practice in that use of evidence based  techniques for perineal repair were better utilised several months after  ‘actively’ delivering the pearls-qi intervention, albeit to a lesser extent  compared to phase 2. we can only speculate possible reasons for the inability  to sustain the same level of improvement. this could be related to the impact  of the training in changing attitudes dissipating, or more likely, related to staff  service and training rotations between clinical areas diluting the number of  those receiving the qi intervention and still involved in intrapartum care. thus  reinforcing the need for regular, on-going updates in perineal training for those  clinicians involved in intrapartum care.    there are numerous examples of delay in implementing evidence into clinical  practice associated with poor patient outcomes 23-26. several barriers are  reported as underlying reasons for this, including lack of resources and  organisational support, increased workload and individuals’ resistance to 


   19 change. burry and mead (1998) suggested that to facilitate local  implementation of evidence based practice, change should be managed  locally, there should be clarity about the expected benefits and that one  should ensure involvement of all interested parties 27. pearls was designed  as a pragmatic trial, hence in addition to testing the intervention, we wanted to  ensure we used a pragmatic approach for its delivery. therefore, the findings  of our national midwifery survey helped us to understand some of the barriers  and facilitators to implementation of evidence to enhance management and  outcomes of perineal trauma. we believe that use of a local, trained pearls  facilitator in each cluster increased the sense of local ownership of the project  and generalizability of the study findings. indeed knowledge translation for  healthcare professionals and consumers is more likely to be successful if the  choice of translation strategy is informed by an assessment of the likely  barriers and facilitators 28.    there are some limitations to our study.  we did not ask facilitators to  document how many clinicians received pearls training as we considered  that this would have been an additional burden and anticipated that some staff  would require on-going training.   as the sample size calculation was based  on the primary outcome measure, there was low power for some secondary  outcomes, which occurred infrequently.  over half of women who met the  study inclusion criteria were not recruited, an issue, which reflects the  pragmatic nature of the study where service demands can compete with  recruitment. this discrepancy could also be a reflection of participants’ choice  because we were only able to include women within a cluster if they 


   20 consented to participate. thirdly, of the women for whom a completed entry  detail form was available, the percentages returning 10-12 day questionnaires  were 62%, 49% and 57% for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and for the  three-month questionnaire were 49%, 40% and 53% respectively. the data  analysis assumes questionnaires are missing completely at random; bias  might result if this was not the case. however, we note that response rates  are comparable in the three phases and between both sets of clusters (e.g.  for phase 2, the 10-12 day questionnaire had a response rate of 54% for  group a and 55% for group b, and for the 3 month questionnaire had a  response rate of 38% for group a and 44% for group b). finally, the ratio of  the number of women in group a clusters relative to women in group b  clusters was 1.37 for phase 1, 1.75 for phase 2 and 1.36 for phase 3. the  reasons for, and implications of, the ratio being higher than 1, and being  higher in phase 2 compared to phases 1 and 3 are unknown and could reflect  wider individual organisational issues not addressed within the study.     in contrast, there are several strengths to our study. the risk of group  contamination is minimised by the use of a cluster design with matched paired  maternity centres as the unit of intervention allocation. the pragmatic nature  of the trial, cascading the intervention by means of local trained facilitators,  and the inclusion of a range of maternity units and birth centres increases the  external validity of the study and make the findings generalizable to the uk.  additionally, publication of the trial protocol, pre-specification of the primary  outcome, large sample size and extended follow-up period are important  further strengths of the study design.  


   21   in england, the clinical negligence scheme for trusts (cnst) handles all  clinical negligence claims against member nhs bodies. membership  contributions are influenced by several factors including the achievement of  certain risk management and clinical standards. in line with cnst standards,  most member nhs hospital are currently addressing clinical training provision  in perineal assessment and repair to comply with cnst recommendations.  nevertheless, there is currently no standardised tested package to deliver this  training or audit its impact. similar to the implementation of the evidence  based continuous suturing technique, the improvement in women’s reported  outcomes was not sustained to the same level of original improvement when  assessed in phase 3. this highlights that although the pearls-qi  intervention was effective in improving the implementation of evidence into  practice, which had a positive impact on some aspects of women’s health, it is  important to ensure training is actively embedded within routine clinical care to  ensure its impact is sustained. undoubtedly, this fits in with the current model  proposed by cnst where clinicians involved in intrapartum care are expected  to receive regular perineal repair and management updates.  the extent to  which this is currently happening is not known.    conclusion:  the accurate assessment and appropriate repair of perineal trauma require  an awareness and understanding of the supporting evidence, together with a  high level of clinical skill and competency to ensure perineal tissues and  structures are aligned correctly to promote healing and minimise morbidity.  


   22 delivering and cascading multi-professional training within maternity units by  means of the pearls-qi intervention was associated with a significant  improvement in adherence to evidence based repair practice and some of the  women’s reported outcomes. however, regular training updates are essential  to sustain the same level of improvement. an e-learning version of the  pearls-qi intervention is now available for online access through stratog  (the rcog e-learning resource). with approximately 400,000 women  sustaining perineal trauma during childbirth per annum in the uk, the clinical  impact of this study cannot be underestimated, particularly if viewed in relation  to its potential global benefit.     acknowledgment:  the pearls team would like to acknowledge the pearls units’ facilitators  (supplementary list provided), dr robert hills (rh) for his expert advice at the  initial stages of study design, securing funding, cluster matching and  randomisation, mrs linda lucking for her help with study set up and professor  mary steen and dr kenda crozier for their input throughout the different  stages of the study. the team would also like to thank members of the trial  steering group for their expert advice (supplementary list provided) and the  women who agreed to participate in this study. pearls was supported by a  grant from the health foundation - engaging with quality initiative.    conflict of interest  kmki and ck run perineal repair workshops both nationally and  internationally and have developed an episiotomy and second-degree tear
