contains a variety of foods, including at least ﬁve portions of fruit and vegetables per day, plenty of starchy foods (particularly wholegrain varieties), some protein-rich foods and some milk and dairy foods. it is also recom- mended that foods high in fat (especially saturated fat), salt and sugar should only be consumed in small amounts.7 data from the national diet and nutrition survey in 2010 indicated that children aged 4–10 years consume an average of 173 g of fruit and vegetables daily, equivalent to 2.2 80 g portions (or 2.8 including fruit juice).8 data from longitudinal cohorts are beginning to uncover the associations between low levels of pa and unfavourable body composition, for example, janz et al,9 but data on the relationship between diet/dietary compo- nents and body composition have so far been equivocal, as reviewed by must et al.10 this may be due to the contrast- ing methods of dietary assessment and analysis and the complexity of dietary patterns; given the importance of energy balance in maintenance of a healthy body weight, it is vital that measurement of dietary intake continues to be improved. evidence of the impact of objectively mea- sured pa/sedentary behaviour (sb) and food intake on body composition in primary school-age children is lacking, with most studies measuring either pa or food intake. a recent scottish study assessed the effect of dietary patterns and pa on body mass index (bmi),11 but used a questionnaire that is known to overestimate time spent in pa.12 the authors did not ﬁnd a consistent associ- ation between dietary patterns or time spent in pa and bmi group.11 the primary aim of the present study was to describe the relationship between ow and ob, bmi, pa and dietary habits in a sample of children that are socio- economically representative of northeast england.13 methods participants the gateshead millennium study (gms) cohort originally consisted of 1029 babies and their families and is described in detail elsewhere.13 brieﬂy, all mothers resi- dent in gateshead who gave birth within prespeciﬁed recruiting weeks between june 1999 and may 2000 were invited to take part; 81% (n=1011) agreed. participants were mostly from the white ethnic majority (98%). data collection for the present study involved a variety of life- style and anthropometric measures, and took place between october 2006 and december 2007 when the chil- dren were aged 6–8 years. the data presented are cross- sectional from the 6–8-year collection phase of the gms. parents provided informed written consent for their child’s participation and children gave their written assent. measures pa and sb pa and sb were objectively measured using actigraph gt1m accelerometers (actigraph llc, pensacola, florida, usa) attached to an elastic belt and worn on the right hip as described previously.14 children were asked to wear the accelerometer during waking hours for 7 days and to remove it only for water-based activities. parents were asked to complete a timelog detailing when the accelerometer had been worn. the accelerometers collected data in 15 s sampling intervals (epochs); prior to analysis, the data were col- lapsed to 60 s epochs. data were veriﬁed manually using the timelog and accelerometry output as described pre- viously12 to delete occasional periods of non-wear time. three constructs of pa and one of sb were generated: total volume of activity (expressed as mean daily acceler- ometer counts per minute, cpm), mvpa daily, equivalent to energy expenditure in excess of approximately three times resting energy expenditure (expressed as minutes/ day and percentage of daily time spent in mvpa) and sb (equivalent to no translocation of the trunk15 (expressed as percentage of daily time spent in sb)). the cutpoint of ≥3200 cpm16 was used to deﬁne mvpa and <1100 cpm17 was used to deﬁne sb. the actigraph gt1m model has been shown to have a con- sistent 9% bias relative to model 716418 from which the cutpoints were derived, so a +9% correction was applied to the raw accelerometry data before applying cutpoints. of 606 accelerometers given out, 510 were worn for at least 3 days and for at least 6 h/day19 and thus were deemed eligible for analysis in the present study. dietary intake food intake in the children was assessed over 4 days (2 weekdays and 2 weekend days) using the ‘food assessment in schools tool’ (fast) food diary.20 the fast food diary is a prospective dietary assessment method which incorporates elements of the food diary and the food frequency methods and was speciﬁcally designed to assess the diets of primary school children. brieﬂy, each day is split into six timeslots, each contain- ing a simple tick list of up to 50 foods commonly eaten by children of this age.21 space for additional foods was also provided. researchers and lay observers recorded food intake for each child during the school day, and parents and other carers recorded food intake at all other times. no interviews or estimations of portion size were required during data collection; average age- speciﬁc and sex-speciﬁc portion sizes for all foods con- sumed were ascertained using relevant uk national diet and nutrition survey data.20 21 this method allowed analysis of food choice at an individual level but not of energy intake. a ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ dietary indicator score was created for each of the 4 days, and a daily mean calcu- lated. the ‘healthy’ indicator (hi) score was calculated by summing the number of portions consumed of the following foods: wholemeal bread; non-high sugar wholegrain breakfast cereals; fruit; vegetables; semi- skimmed milk as a drink; semi-skimmed milk; non- processed meat and ﬁsh products; beans and pulses; water and white bread with added ﬁbre. the ‘unhealthy’ 2 basterfield l, jones ar, parkinson kn, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005001. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005001 open access


indicator (ui) score was calculated by summing the number of portions consumed of the following foods: white bread; high-sugar reﬁned breakfast cereals; fried chips; biscuits; confectionery, cakes and sweet puddings; full-fat milk as a drink; full-fat milk; processed meat and ﬁsh products; full-sugar cordial or squash; full-sugar car- bonated drinks; chocolate/milkshake powder; crisps and savoury snacks and sugar. a cereal was categorised as ‘non-high sugar’ if it contained <5 g sugar/100 g and ‘high sugar’ if it contained >15 g sugar/100 g as manu- factured. the addition of discretionary sugar was not taken into account when categorising cereals. to assess adherence to dietary guidelines, fruit and vegetable con- sumption was measured in 80 g amounts, fruit juice in 150 ml portions. only one portion of fruit juice may count towards daily fruit and vegetable intake.7 anthropometry all body measurements were taken in duplicate with the children in light indoor clothing, without socks and shoes. height was measured to 0.1 cm with a leicester portable height measure (chasmors, london, uk), waist to 0.1 cm at the minimum circumference between the lowest rib and iliac crest, and weight to 0.1 kg using a tanita tbf 300ma body fat analyser (chasmors, london, uk). bmi was calculated as (wt (kg)/ht (m2)). categories of underweight, healthy weight, ow and ob were calculated according to age-speciﬁc and sex-speciﬁc international obesity taskforce (iotf) criteria.22 23 statistical analysis the sample size for the current cross-sectional study was ﬁxed by the size of the cohort, participant attrition and those children providing complete data for pa, dietary intake and anthropometry at this data sweep. analysis was performed using spss v.17 and stata v.10. shapiro-wilk tests assessed the normality of distri- bution of variables. as data were skewed, mann-whitney u tests were performed to test for differences between sexes and wilcoxon rank tests to assess differences in weekend and weekday pa/sb. median and iqrs were reported unless otherwise stated. logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being ow/ob at different levels of pa and with different dietary indicator scores. children were assigned to one of the three pa categories: (1) ‘active’: those who met the ≥60 min/day guideline (this ﬁgure was generated by dividing the total amount of mvpa for the week by the number of days the accelerometer was worn); (2) ‘moderately active’: between 30 and 60 min/day; (3) ‘inactive’: less than 30 min/ day. children were also assigned to one of the three dietary categories: (1) ‘healthy’: those children whose hi score was ≥the median and whose ui score was < the median; (2) ‘unhealthy’: those children whose ui score was ≥the median and whose hi score < the median; (3) ‘mixed’: those diets which neither met the criteria for a ‘healthy’ diet nor for an ‘unhealthy’ diet. children were lastly classiﬁed by bmi as: (1) not ow/ob; (2) ow/ob. ors and corresponding 95% cis were reported. signiﬁcance was set at p<0.05. sex was included in the regression analysis as a potential confounder. townsend score from birth (a measure of deprivation) was unrelated to any of the variables and thus not included in the ﬁnal analysis. results overall, 510 children completed sufﬁcient accelerometry recording; 474 children returned completed fast food diaries and 597 children had anthropometry measure- ments. data from all three domains were provided by 425 children and were used in the analysis. there were no signiﬁcant differences in food intake, pa or bmi between children providing complete records and those who did not. children had a mean age of 7.4 years (range 6.4–8.4). characteristics of the sample are dis- played in table 1. using iotf cut-offs,22 24% of the children were ow/ob, with no signiﬁcant difference between girls and boys (mann-whitney u test, p=0.885). the full dis- tribution of children between weight categories is shown in table 2. there were no signiﬁcant differences between the sexes in the number of days the activity belt was worn or the total volume of activity (mean cpm; table 3). table 1 participant characteristics (median and iqr), by sex combined* (n=425) boys (n=211) (49.6%) girls (n=214) (50.4%) p value height (cm) 1.24 1.21, 1.29 1.26 1.22, 1.29 1.24 1.21, 1.28 0.039 weight (kg) 26.4 22.7, 28.7 25.7 23.0, 29.1 25.0 22.5, 28.4 0.264 waist (cm) 55.7 52.6, 59.0 56.5 53.5, 59.4 54.8 52.1, 58.7 0.006 bmi (kg/m2) 16.2 15.3, 17.8 16.1 15.4, 17.8 16.3 15.2, 17.8 0.878 *n for individual measures varying from 421 to 425. mann-whitney u tests performed. bmi, body mass index. italic font indicates significant results. basterfield l, jones ar, parkinson kn, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005001. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005001 3 open access


levels of activity in general were low, as reported previ- ously;12 only 31 children (7%) achieved an average of at least 60 min mvpa/ day, 23 boys and 8 girls. only two children (0.5%) accumulated at least 60 min on each day they wore the accelerometer. the majority of time was spent in sb (median 78% of wear time, equivalent to around 8.6 h/day). when looking at the differences between weekend and weekday activity, volume of activity (cpm) was similar, and slightly but signiﬁcantly more mvpa was taken on weekdays (p<0.0001; data not shown). girls had a greater volume of activity on week- ends but a lower time spent in mvpa, suggesting that the majority of their activities are in the sedentary or light intensity categories. boys spent signiﬁcantly more time in mvpa on weekdays than girls. dietary intake was similar for boys and girls (table 3). children consumed a median of 1.7 portions of fruit and vegetables daily (or 2.1 portions when including fruit juice), with just 13/425 children (3.1%) consuming ‘5 a day’. on average, children ate 5.0 hi foods and 5.3 ui foods daily. table 4 displays the distribution of ow/ob by diet and activity group. 13% of healthy weight boys were in the ‘active’ pa cat- egory, compared with just 4% of ow/ob boys. 48% of healthy weight boys were inactive compared with 76% of ow/ob boys. there was less variation for girls, as only eight girls in total were in the active category. in total, 59% of healthy weight girls were in the inactive category compared with 71% of ow/ob girls. compared with the reference group (inactive), chil- dren in the moderately active group had a signiﬁcantly lower risk of being ow/ob (or=0.44, 0.26 to 0.74 (table 5)). table 2 distribution of children between weight categories, by sex combined boys (49.6%) girls (50.4%) n per cent n per cent n per cent underweight 3 0.7 1 0.5 2 0.9 healthy weight 320 75.3 160 75.8 160 74.8 overweight 75 17.6 35 16.6 40 18.7 obese 27 6.4 15 7.1 12 5.6 total 425 100.0 211 100.0 214 100.0 table 3 comparison of physical activity, sedentary behaviour (sb) and dietary intake between sexes (median and iqr unless otherwise specified) combined (n=425) boys (n=211) girls (n=214) p value physical activity/sb number of days accelerometer worn 7 6, 7 7 6, 7 7 6, 7 0.380 hours worn/day 11.3 10.6, 11.9 11.4 10.7, 12.0 11.1 10.4, 11.8 0.077 mean cpm/day 727 604, 878 740 624, 881 718 591, 868 0.313 mvpa (min/day) 26 18, 38 28 19, 43 25 16, 36 0.020 percentage of time in mvpa 3.9 2.6, 5.7 4.2 2.7, 6.3 3.8 2.5, 5.5 0.043 percentage of time sb 77.7 73.6, 81.8 76.9 71.9, 80.8 78.4 74.6, 82.7 0.002 achieved 60 min/day mvpa (n, %)* 31 7.3 23 10.9 8 3.7 0.005 dietary intake portions of fruit and vegetables consumed/day 1.7 1.1, 2.5 1.7 1.0, 2.5 1.8 1.2, 2.5 0.211 portions of fruit and vegetables consumed/day† 2.1 1.4, 3.0 2.0 1.3, 2.9 2.2 1.4, 3.1 0.224 ate 5 portions of fruit and vegetables/day (n, %)† 13 3.1 8 3.8 5 2.3 0.384 number of healthy indicator foods/day 5.0 3.8, 6.5 5.0 3.8, 6.5 5.1 3.8, 6.5 0.342 number of unhealthy indicator foods/day 5.3 4.3, 6.3 5.5 4.3, 6.3 5.3 4.3, 6.3 0.496 *total mvpa for the week/days worn. †including one 150 ml portion of juice. mann–whitney u tests performed. sb, sedentary behaviour; mvpa, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity. italic font indicates significant results. 4 basterfield l, jones ar, parkinson kn, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005001. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005001 open access


results for children in the active group (≥60 min mvpa/ day, or=0.34, 95% ci 0.12 to 1.02) approached signiﬁcance (p=0.054). similar results were seen after adjusting for sex. when analysing girls and boys separ- ately, the association between pa and risk of ow/ob remained only for boys. boys who were moderately active had an or of 0.33 (0.15 to 0.72) for risk of ow/ob (p=0.005), and boys in the active category had an or of 0.20 (0.04 to 0.88; p=0.033), compared with the inactive group. moderately active girls had an or of 0.56 (0.28 to 1.14; p=0.112) and active girls an or of 0.86 (0.17 to 4.48; p=0.863) for ow/ob compared with inactive girls. similar results were seen for activity when adjusting for diet group. there was no inﬂuence of dietary pattern on risk of ow/ob: or 1.27 (0.73 to 2.19; p=0.40) for the mixed diet group, 1.28 (0.71 to 2.33) for the healthy group (p=0.41) compared with the reference group (unhealthy diet; table 5), with similar results after adjusting for sex. there was no evidence of an interaction between pa and food intake on risk of ow/ob (p=0.444). discussion our results provide evidence that children in northeast england are not meeting the guidelines for pa and nutrition that are recommended for good health. lack of mvpa was associated with an increased risk of being ow and ob in boys. the lack of association in girls could be due to the low numbers being sufﬁciently active. the present study has limitations in terms of the eth- nically homogeneous sample, which may limit the gener- alisability of the ﬁndings to other samples and settings. there was also a lack of variability in pa, with data skewed towards inactivity, particularly in girls. there are several cutpoints in use for classifying mvpa24 and the value of 3200 cpm used in the current study was obtained through comparison with energy expend- iture,16 and similar to those from other studies.15 given the ongoing discussion regarding the choice of cutpoint, there may be no suitable cutpoint for all ages of child- hood. as the data are cross-sectional, it is not possible to determine the direction of causality, which will be addressed by future follow-up. however, the strengths of this study include the relatively large sample size, the focused age of the children, and the use of objective measures of pa (accelerometry) combined with dietary observations is unique. few other studies have used objective methods to describe levels of habitual pa and sb in 6–8-year-olds in combination with dietary intake measures. recent uk studies in 3–5-year-olds14 and 11–12-year-olds25 which have used the same objective methods of pa measurement have found similarly low levels of pa with adherence to the 60 min/day recommendation of mvpa being achieved in <5% of their samples. in contrast, uk studies which have used subjective methods (questionnaires) have generally table 4 distribution of ow/ob by pa and dietary category (n, %) healthy weight (323, 76.0) overweight or obese (102, 24.0) dietary pattern dietary pattern pa category unhealthy mixed healthy total unhealthy mixed healthy total boys (211, 49.6) inactive 27, 16.8 33, 20.5 18, 11.2 78, 48.4 11, 22.0 13, 26.0 14, 28.0 38, 76.0 moderately active 17, 10.6 28, 17.4 17, 10.6 62, 38.5 2, 4.0 7, 14.0 1, 2.0 10, 20.0 active 9, 5.6 10, 6.2 2, 1.2 21, 13.0 0, 0.0 1, 2.0 1, 2.0 2, 4.0 total 53, 32.9 71, 44.1 37, 23.0 161, 100.0 13, 26.0 21, 42.0 16, 32.0 50, 100.0 girls (214, 50.4) inactive 27, 16.7 29, 17.9 40, 24.7 96, 59.3 9, 17.3 18, 34.6 10, 19.2 37, 71.2 moderately active 17, 10.5 31, 19.1 12, 7.4 60, 37.0 4, 7.7 4, 7.7 5, 9.6 13, 25.0 active 1, 0.6 3, 1.9 2, 1.2 6, 3.7 0, 0.0 2, 3.8 0, 0.0 2, 3.8 total 45, 27.8 63, 38.9 54, 33.3 162, 100.0 13, 25.0 24, 46.2 15, 28.8 52, 100.0 ow/ob, overweight or obese; pa, physical activity. table 5 likelihood of being overweight or obese for different activity levels and dietary patterns (ors and 95% ci) combined (n=425) p value boys (n=211) p value girls (n=214) p value inactive (reference) 1 1 1 moderately active 0.44 (0.26 to 0.74) 0.002 0.33 (0.15 to 0.72) 0.005 0.56 (0.28 to 1.14) 0.112 active 0.34 (0.12 to 1.02) 0.054 0.20 (0.04 to 0.88) 0.033 0.86 (0.17 to 4.48) 0.863 unhealthy diet (reference) 1 1 1 mixed diet 1.27 (0.73 to 2.19) 0.40 1.21 (0.55 to 2.62) 0.637 1.32 (0.61 to 2.86) 0.485 healthy diet 1.28 (0.71 to 2.33) 0.41 1.76 (0.76 to 4.10) 0.188 0.96 (0.42 to 2.23) 0.927 italic font indicates significant results. basterfield l, jones ar, parkinson kn, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005001. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005001 5 open access


reported much higher levels of mvpa, for example, the health survey for england, which leads to overestimates of pa.12 low levels of pa were present in our sample well before puberty, the period traditionally regarded as being associated with low levels of pa. in keeping with other studies,9 26 we found that boys were more active than girls, and the lack of association of pa on risk of ow/ob in girls as compared with boys suggests further work is required into the mechanisms by which increasing pa and/or decreasing sb reduces risk of ow/ob in children. few studies have looked at the relationship between the ‘60 min’ guidelines and body composition. martinez-gomez et al27 reported that 60 min/day mvpa could discriminate between normal weight and ow/ob adolescents (mean age 14.7 years), however they used a lower cutpoint for mvpa of 2000 cpm, compared with the 3200 cpm used in the present study. this resulted in average mvpa/ day of 66 min for boys and 50 min for girls.27 recent evidence using 3200 cpm as the mvpa cut- point for 10-year-olds in france28 found that only 10% of the ‘normal weight’ children reached 60 min/day, but 44% did at least 30 min/day. in addition, although only 5% of ow/ob children did at least 60 min/day mvpa, 34% reached 30 min/day.28 our results show that this lower recommendation could still have beneﬁts in terms of body composition, particularly for boys. while it is generally accepted that pa decreases with age,29 pinpointing the age when the decrease starts is important for targeted interventions. our results suggest that even at the age of 7 years, pa levels are far lower than recommended. the great proportion of time spent seden- tary by both sexes is concerning—in both sexes almost 7 h/day were spent with no translocation of the trunk.15 both sexes took part in more mvpa on weekdays than weekends, highlighting the role the school environment plays in maintaining activity levels, and that more needs to be done to increase activity on weekends. the cross- sectional nature of the present study means we cannot say whether the children have already started to reduce their activity. however, data we have published from the cohort at a 2-year follow-up show a decrease in mvpa from age 7 to 9 years, and the decrease in mvpa associated with an increase in bmi-z score in boys.30 31 the low consumption of fruit and vegetables, and the relatively high consumption of an unhealthy diet in this sample is cause for concern, despite the lack of association between the ‘healthy’ or ‘unhealthy’ categories and risk of ow/ob. the lack of association between dietary variables and risk of ow/ob in this study, as in others, may be due to the lack of individual portion sizes which prohibited the assessment of energy intake. the dietary assessment tool used in this study allowed direct observation of intake but applied standard portion sizes from a previous national diet and nutrition survey which used a weighed intake method.21 the amount for a ‘portion’ of fruit and vegeta- bles was set at 80 g, which is considered suitable for chil- dren aged over 11 years.32 a lower amount may be more suitable for children under 11 years, but as this has not yet been identiﬁed,32 80 g was used in this analysis. it is pos- sible that ow children are eating larger portions of healthy foods, or the parents are aware of their child’s ow and have reduced food intake accordingly. there may also be an element of misreporting or optimistic bias if the parent believes their child is ow and eats either to excess or ‘unhealthily’. foods in the current study were assigned to the ‘healthy’ or ‘unhealthy’ group based on a combin- ation of current national guidelines for consumption and restriction7 according to nutritional content. since these analyses were performed, frémeaux et al33 have published a longitudinal factor analysis of english children’s food intake from age 5 to 13 years. they reported the emer- gence of two main diet types that matched almost identi- cally with ours.33 recent evidence from scottish 5–11- year-olds did not ﬁnd an association between dietary pat- terns and bmi or pa,11 and observed an inverse association between ‘screen time’ and healthier eating patterns (diet measured with food frequency questionnaire (ffq) and pa measured by physical activity questionnaire, paq). the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac) cohort in the uk was assessed for associations between pa and diet at age 10–11 years, and found only weak relationships between the two34 (3×1-day food diary at 10 years, accelerometry at 11 years). a greek case–control study found a protective effect of pa35 on risk of ow/ob, and an increased risk with increased time spent watching tv, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (ffq/ paq), an observation also reported in spanish children (ffq/paq).36 others37 found an effect of sb on risk of ow/ob, but again no effect of diet composition (ques- tionnaire). a varied food pattern plus a physically active life- style was inversely related to ow in french children (7-day food diary/paq).38 similarly, reduced pa, but not excessive energy intake, was associated with increased risk of ob in turkish children (3-day food diary/paq).39 however, these studies included a wide age range of children, and pa and sb were measured objectively only in the alspac cohort,34 so our observations strengthen the evidence base for the protective effects of pa on risk of ow/ob. in conclusion, children in northeast england have extremely low levels of habitual mvpa, high levels of sb and consume a diet low in fruit and vegetables but high in foods associated with an unhealthy diet. increased pa was asso- ciated with reduced risk of ow/ob in boys. further work is required to uncover the associations of pa/diet and ow/ ob in girls and the longitudinal associations between pa/ diet and ow/ob in boys and girls. these observations give cause for concern in relation to their current and future risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and ob. our observa- tions suggest that uk government targets in relation to levels of pa and nutrition among children are not being met. acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support of an external reference group in conducting the study. they appreciate the support of
