however, increasing evidence suggests that the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder increases following an mtbi.4 although multiple studies have investigated post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), the risk of other disorders, such as depression, has also been found to increase following an mtbi.5 the most common psychi- atric disorders during the ﬁrst 12 months following an injury are depression, anxiety disorder and agoraphobia.4 diminished sleep quality is one of the most commonly reported symptoms following an mtbi,6 and depression and anxiety are also prevalent. however, these condi- tions are often under-reported, and may become chronic in the absence of treatment. the objectives of our study were to characterise the course of post-mtbi depression, anxiety and diminished sleep quality during a 6-week follow-up, and to compare the baseline and 6-week clinical assessments of patients with mtbi with those of healthy participants. methods participants and study design our prospective study was approved by the joint institutional review board of taipei medical university. eligible patients aged ≥20 years who were treated in an emergency room within 24 h after closed head trauma were recruited from three hospitals in taiwan between january 2011 and july 2012. the deﬁnition of mtbi was based on the diagnostic criteria established by the american congress of rehabilitation medicine, which consist of a glasgow coma scale (gcs) score of 13–15 at presentation and loss of consciousness for <30 min. patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease, mental retardation, previous tbi, epilepsy or severe systemic medical illness were excluded from our study. the inclu- sion criteria for the healthy control participants were no brain injury history and age over 20 years. patients were initially contacted through phone. a total of 607 patients with mtbi were recruited for our study, among whom 250 (41.19%) provided informed consent, and completed a baseline assessment during an initial evaluation within 1 month after experiencing an mtbi. six weeks after completing the baseline assess- ment, 100 (40%) patients with mtbi completed the ﬁnal assessment. the baseline and 6-week assessments consisted of four investigator-administered question- naires, namely the beck anxiety inventory (bai),7 the beck depression inventory ii (bdi),8 the epworth sleepiness scale (ess)9 and the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi).10 outcome measures the patients’ demographic information, injury-related data and smoking and drinking history were recorded at the baseline evaluation. chinese versions of the bdi, the bai, the ess and the psqi were used in our study.11–13 depression was assessed using the bdi, which scored the patient’s selection of one of four possible responses to 21 multiple-choice items on a scale of 0–3 based on their response. the severity of anxiety symptoms was assessed using the bai, which also scored the patient’s selection of one of four possible responses to 21 multiple-choice items on a scale of 0–3 based on their response. a high score on the bai indicates a high level of anxiety. daytime sleepiness was subjectively assessed using the ess, which asked the patient to rate their risk of falling asleep on a 4-point likert scale (0–3) in eight different situations. overall sleep quality was assessed using the psqi, which evaluated seven aspects of sleep quality. a high overall score on the psqi indi- cates a poor sleep quality. statistical methods associations between the categorical variables were eval- uated using a χ² analysis, and the fisher exact test was used when at least one of the values was <5. associations between the normally distributed continuous variables were evaluated using t tests, and the mann–whitney u test was used to evaluate the continuous variables with an asymmetrical distribution. paired t tests and a paired mann–whitney u test were used to evaluate the intragroup differences between the baseline and 6-week assessments for normally and asymmetrically distributed data, respectively. in this study, all outcomes were abnor- mally distributed, thus the non-parametric method was used. in addition, generalised linear regression analyses were conducted for outcomes with or without adjust- ment for age and sex. all the statistical analyses were performed using the r statistical software, v.3.0.1 for windows (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria). the level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at p<0.05. results the demographic information and clinical data of all the mtbi and control participants who were initially enrolled in the study are shown in table 1. six weeks fol- lowing their baseline assessment, 150 patients could not be contacted, or declined to participate further in our study. the age, sex, education level, smoking status, alcohol use, proportion reporting depression, mechan- ism of injury and gcs, bdi, ess scores of patients who completed the study did not differ signiﬁcantly from those of patients who did not complete the study. the patients who did not complete the study had lower mean scores for the bai and the psqi than the patients who completed the study. the demographic information and clinical data of the 100 patients with mtbi and the 137 control participants who completed the study are shown in table 2. the mean age of the mtbi group was signiﬁcantly higher than the mean age of the control group. the propor- tions reporting alcohol use, headache and depression were signiﬁcantly different between the mtbi and 2 ma h-p, ou j-c, yeh c-t, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004205. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004205 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by

control groups. the percentages of patients with mtbi who reported headache or depression were higher than those of the control group. transportation accidents and falls caused 39% and 34% of the mtbi cases, respect- ively. considering the clinical cut-off for each question- naire, most of the control patients did not have depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness or diminished sleep quality, whereas most of the patients with mtbi had high psqi scores. the mean scores of the four outcome measures are shown in ﬁgure 1. the average scores for the patients with mtbi at baseline were the highest. after 6 weeks, the average scores for the patients with mtbi decreased. the differences between the outcomes of the mtbi and control groups are shown in table 3. the average base- line and 6-week bai scores for mtbi group were 10.74 and 7.23, respectively. the bai scores of the patients in the mtbi group signiﬁcantly improved at 6 weeks postin- jury. however, the mean bai scores for the mtbi group for the baseline and 6-week assessments were signiﬁ- cantly different from those of the control group at the baseline assessment. the mean bdi scores of the mtbi group were 9.8 and 7.99 at the baseline and 6-week assessments, respectively. the mean bdi score for mtbi group signiﬁcantly decreased to the value of 1.81 at 6 weeks postinjury. the mean bdi score of the control group was 5.72. the mean bdi scores of the mtbi group were signiﬁcantly different from those of the control group. no signiﬁcant difference was observed between the baseline and 6-week ess scores for the mtbi group. the mean daytime sleepiness score for the control group was 6.62, which was not signiﬁcantly different from that of the mtbi group. the mean baseline psqi score for the mtbi group was greater than 9, which was higher than the clinical cut-off point of 5. in addition, the mean psqi score of mtbi at baseline assessment was higher than the mean score of 5.7 for the control group. the mean 6-week psqi score for the mtbi group improved signiﬁcantly to 6.4. the sleep quality of the mtbi group at 6 weeks postinjury was not signiﬁ- cantly different from that of the control group. owing to the signiﬁcant difference in mean age between the mtbi and control groups and the predominance of women in both groups, we performed generalised linear table 1 demographic and clinical data of all patients with mtbi initially enrolled in our study lost to follow-up completed 6-week follow-up p value age (years) 38.88 39.53 ns male/female (n) 56/94 35/65 ns education (years) 15.04 15.46 ns smoker (n/y) 113/37 82/18 ns drink alcohol (n/y) 94/56 58/ 42 ns headache (n/y) 50/100 25/75 0.02 depression (n/y) 91/59 51/49 ns gcs 14.80 14.98 ns mechanism of injury transportation accident 77 39 ns falls 40 34 other 33 27 bai 7.85 10.74 .03 bdi 8.19 9.80 ns ess 6.89 7.95 ns psqi 6.27 9.51 <0.01 bai, beck anxiety inventory; bdi, beck depression inventory ii; ess, epworth sleepiness scale; gcs, glasgow coma scale; mtbi, mild traumatic brain injury; ns, p>0.05; psqi, pittsburgh sleep quality index. table 2 demographic and clinical data of the patients with mtbi and the control participants who completed the 6-week follow-up mtbi control p value sample size (n) 100 137 age (years) 39.53 29.86 <0.001 male/female (n) 35/65 47/90 ns education (years) 15.46 14.91 0.045 smoker (n/y) 82/18 115/22 ns drink (n/y) 58/42 51/82 <0.01 headache (n/y) 25/75 98/39 <0.01 depression (n/y) 51/49 103/34 <0.01 gcs 14.98 – – questionnaires bai >7 (n/y) 57/43 125/12 <0.01 bdi >9 (n/y) 53/47 111/26 <0.01 ess >9 (n/y) 66/34 108/29 <0.01 psqi >5 (n/y) 10/90 77/60 <0.01 mechanisms of injury transportation accident 39 – – falls 34 – – other 27 – – bai, beck anxiety inventory; bdi, beck depression inventory ii; ess, epworth sleepiness scale; gcs, glasgow coma scale; mtbi, mild traumatic brain injury; ns, p>0.05; psqi, pittsburgh sleep quality index. ma h-p, ou j-c, yeh c-t, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004205. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004205 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


regression analysis of the outcome measures with adjust- ing for age and sex (table 4). the differences in depres- sion, anxiety and sleep quality between the mtbi and control patients kept signiﬁcance after adjusting for age or sex. however, sex was found to be a signiﬁcant pre- dictor of sleep quality, anxiety and depression in the baseline and 6-week assessments. after adjusting for age and sex, the ess score was signiﬁcantly different between the control and mtbi groups at the baseline and 6-week assessments, and age was determined to be a signiﬁcant predictor of daytime sleepiness. in addition, the scores for all four outcome measures were higher among women than among men. discussion previous studies have shown that 85% of patients with mtbi demonstrate improvement in psychiatric-related symptoms, whereas the remainder develop chronic psy- chosocial problems.14–16 often presenting with anxiety, depression or sleep disturbances, patients with tbi are at an increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder within 3 months to 1-year postinjury.4 it is unclear whether post-mtbi sleep disturbances are related to depression or anxiety. thus, sleep disturbance may be a risk factor of subsequent depression. a meta-analysis of 21 studies demonstrated that insomnia patients have a twofold risk of developing depression.17 the detailed course of post-mtbi depression, anxiety and diminished sleep quality, especially during the early stages of recovery, has not been well characterised. we examined the early stages of recovery from mtbi by using self-reported measures of depression, anxiety, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. most of them were injured by transportation accident and falls. other mechanism of injury included hit by something, and sport injury. there was no participant who was injured by an industrial accident. we determined that daytime sleepiness is not signiﬁcantly affected by mtbi. the anxiety and depression symptoms in the mtbi group improved by the sixth week of recovery, but remained more severe than those of the control partici- pants. however, sleep quality signiﬁcantly improved within 6 weeks of experiencing mtbi, returning to a level that did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of the control group. these results indicate that recovery from diminished sleep quality occurred more rapidly than did recovery from depression and anxiety. our prospective cohorts contained more women than men, and the mean ages of the mtbi and control groups differed signiﬁcantly. thus, we adjusted our ana- lysis for effects of age and sex. the bai, bdi, psqi and ess scores were inﬂuenced by sex. however, our results demonstrated that the bai, bdi and psqi scores were signiﬁcantly affected by mtbi, whereas the ess scores were not. we found the women in the mtbi group reported more severe symptoms for depression, anxiety and diminished sleep quality at baseline. after 6 weeks of recovery, although the depression-related and anxiety-related symptoms of male and female patients with mtbi improved, those of the female patients with mtbi remained more severe than those of the male patients with mtbi. female patients with mtbi also reported more severe symptoms related to diminished sleep quality and daytime sleepiness than did male patients with mtbi. previous reports of the incidence of insomnia among postacute patients with tbi ranged from 2% to 56%.18 19 bryan20 found that sleep disturbance increases in patients who suffer a repetitive tbi. in our study, 90% of the patients with mtbi and 44% of the control participants reported sleep disturbances. the average score of psqi in the control group (5.7) is higher than the previously published values (2.7),10 but it is close to the result of another study in taiwan also by use of the chinese psqi study in healthy group (5.7).13 it may result from the figure 1 box plot of the baseline and 6-week postinjury assessments of the clinical outcomes. white bars represent the data for the control group. light grey and dark grey bars represent the patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mtbi) at baseline and 6 weeks postinjury, respectively. from left to right, the data for the beck anxiety inventory (bai), the beck depression inventory ii (bdi), the epworth sleepiness scale (ess) and the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) scores are represented. table 3 differences between control participants and patients with mtbi at baseline and 6 weeks postinjury bai bdi ess psqi mtbi baseline vs control 8.02* 4.08* 1.33 3.81* mtbi 6 weeks vs control 4.51* 2.27* 0.87 0.7 mtbi baseline vs mtbi 6 weeks† 3.51* 1.81* 0.46 3.11* *p<0.05. †paired t test. bai, beck anxiety inventory;

different versions of questionnaire (english and chinese) or other uncertain reasons. our data showed that recovery from sleep disturbance occurred more rapidly among the patients with mtbi than did recovery from postinjury depression and anxiety. there are two possible reasons for this ﬁnding. sleep disturbance may be an independent symptom of mtbi that alters the cir- cadian rhythm through injury-related changes in gene expression.21 alternatively, sleep disturbance may simply be a symptom of depression or anxiety that improves early during recovery.22 previous studies have demonstrated signiﬁcant changes in anxiety-related and depression-related symptoms between 1 week and 3 months following an mtbi.23 we observed improvement in the depression and anxiety assessment scores in our mtbi cohort at 6 weeks postin- jury. nonetheless, the bdi and the bai scores differed signiﬁcantly between the mtbi and control groups at the 6-week postinjury assessment. depression and ptsd have been shown to be critical mediators of the recovery of physical health following an mtbi.24 multiple studies have investigated the incidence of ptsd following tbi.25 psychiatric comorbidities have been associated with ptsd following tbi, and depression was shown to be a predictor of the post-tbi chronicity of ptsd.26 27 we did not explore the role of ptsd in recovery from depression, anxiety and diminished sleep quality, but we speculate that ptsd is associated with all of these mental disorders in patients with mtbi. certain limitations to our ﬁndings should be consid- ered. first, some of our patients with mtbi may have used medications before or after suffering mtbi that may have inﬂuenced their assessment scores. second, it is pos- sible that some of our patients with mtbi may have had unrelated diseases or preinjury conditions that were not identiﬁed before or during their participation in our study. third, we investigated only the subacute stages of depression, anxiety and diminished sleep quality, rather than the chronic stages of these diseases. in addition, rem sleep plays an important role in mood disorders. the changes of rem sleep after mtbi are still controver- sial.28 29 this is certainly a major issue for the study. however, sleep architecture was not measured in our study. although long-term observational studies are required to conﬁrm our ﬁndings, our results provide valuable information for understanding the development and recovery of mental disorders following an mtbi. author affiliations 1department of emergency medicine, shuang ho hospital, taipei medical university, new taipei city, taiwan 2department of emergency medicine, school of medicine, taipei medical university, taipei, taiwan 3department of neurology and sleep center, shuang ho hospital, taipei medical university, new taipei city, taiwan 4graduate institute of injury prevention and control, college of public health and nutrition, taipei medical university, taipei, taiwan 5ministry of health and welfare, taipei, taiwan 6department of neurology, school of medicine, taipei medical university, taipei, taiwan 7department of neurology, national defense medical center, taipei, taiwan contributors h-p m participated in conception, design and interpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript and its final approval;
