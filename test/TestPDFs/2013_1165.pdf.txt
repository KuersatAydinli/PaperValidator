3/22  abstract  background    vitamin d and the components of humoral immunity play important roles in human health.  elderly people have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25(oh)d) serum levels than younger  adults. we aimed to determine the levels of 25(oh)d serum concentrations in healthy senior  citizens and to study their relationship to the levels of components of humoral immunity .  methods   1,470 healthy elderly swiss men and women, 60 years or more, were recruited for this study.   179 subjects were dropped out of the study because of elevated serum concentrations of c -  reactive protein. fasting blood sera were analyzed for 25(oh)d with  the high-performance  liquid chromatography (hplc) and for parathyroid hormone (pth), immunoglobulins and  complement c4 & c3 concentrations with immunoassays. the percentage of participants in  each of the four different 25(oh)d deficiency groups severely deficient (<10 ng/ml),  deficient (10-20), insufficient (21-30 ng/ml) and normal (>31 ng/ml) were statistically  compared. a relationship of major components of the humoral system and age to 25(oh)d  levels was also assessed.  results   about 66% of the subjects had insufficient levels of 25(oh)d. normal levels of 25(oh)d  were found in 26.1% of the subjects of which 21% were males and 30.5% were females (total  study population). 7.98% of the total study population had severely deficient levels of  25(oh)d. low levels of 25(oh)d, were positively associated with igg2 (p<0.01) and with  c4 (p<0.02)  yet inversely related to levels of igg1 and iga (p<0.05) and c3 (p<0.01). serum  levels of total iga, igg, igg2, and igg4 peaked together with 25(oh)d during late summer.       


4/22  conclusions  a majority (∼2/3) of the healthy elderly swiss population presented with vitamin d  insufficiency. the incremental shift in iga and c3 levels might not necessarily reflect  deranged humoral immune defense; however, given the high prevalence of vitamin d  deficiency, the importance of this condition in humoral immunity will be worth looking at  more closely. this study supports the role of vitamin d in the competent immune system.       keywords  25(oh)d  immunoglobulins  iga  complement  humoral immunity  sunlight exposure  elderly people 


5/22  background  the biological role of fat-soluble vitamin d has been shown in recent studies to extend far  beyond its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health [1-4]. currently, the structure of  vitamin d receptors and their functions are well understood. once the receptors bind to their  ligand, vdrs dimerize with an isoform of the retinoid x receptor (rxr).  many body tissues  express vdr; furthermore, vdr-rxrs are found on a variety of cells, including  monocytes/macrophages [3],  kidney cells[5], cardiomyocytes [6], skin cells [7] and liver  cells [8]. at each corresponding organ site, the vitamin d/vdr system is associated with  functional organ performance.     experimental, epidemiological and clinical studies have shown inverse associations of low  vitamin d status with longevity and with retarding immunosenescence [9]. 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin d3 (1,25(oh)2d3) blocks the induction of t-helper-1 (th1)-cell cytokines  (e.g., ifnγ) and promotes th2-cell responses. this activity partly explains the decreased b- cell proliferation, plasma-cell differentiation and igg secretion [6, 9, 10]  which is an activity  that conserves efficient immune defense (in particular anti-viral) [3]. the actions of 1,25  (oh)2 d3 on b cell function have been researched for many years [10] and this area has  recently received interest regarding the mechanisms of action [6, 11-14]; for example, a recent  study described an inverse relation of serum total igg levels with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d  (25(oh)d) [15]. although some results remain to be confirmed, low serum 25(oh)d levels  have been linked to all-cause cardiovascular, cancer and infection-related mortality and also  to stroke. furthermore, autoimmunity and some infectious agents may also cause disease  because of insufficient 25(oh)d [11].  throughout the life span, a significant proportion of humans have insufficient (<30 ng/ml) or  deficient (<20 ng/ml) serum 25(oh)d levels. 25(oh)d severe deficiency may be defined as   serum concentrations < 10 ng/ml [16, 17], deficiency as values < 20 and insufficiency as  


6/22  21-29 ng/ml whereby values >30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) shall reflect sufficient concentration [2,  18, 19]. regular exposures to sunlight foster the required hydroxylations to produce the  bioactive compound. the first –oh attachment results in 25-hydroxyvitamin d and the  second in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d).  humans acquire much of their vitamin d  through a photosynthetic reaction in the skin with a small amount via digestive intake [20].  those at risk for vitamin d deficiency are those with little sun exposure and/or poor dietary  intake. older people are especially at risk because aging lowers the amount of 7- dehydrocholesterol in the skin reducing the capacity for vitamin d production.  people with  dark skin have a significantly lower mean serum level of 25(oh)d than those with light skin  across the life-span, but dark skin people have a lower level of vitamin d-binding protein and  consequently more bioactive vitamin d [21]. the acquisition of vitamin d may be hampered  by increased melanin production, as is the case with dark skin or with increased age [22].   the european population is known for transient reductions of 10 – 20% of individual  25(oh)d serum levels measured during the winter months compared to the summer months,  an observation that is particularly prominent in the elderly [23].   the present study was initiated (i) to study the prevalence of insufficiency and deficiency  levels in healthy elderly and (ii) to assess the impact of these deficiencies on immunoglobulin  and complement components c4 and c3 production.                 


7/22    methods  study population  consecutive subjectively healthy elderly volunteers aged 60 years and older were recruited  between february 2009 and july 2010 as part of the senior labor study, which is an ongoing  investigation in the canton of berne (switzerland) initially aimed at creating appropriate  reference intervals (ris) for several analytes in the elderly (http://www.seniorlabor.ch). the  study participants were contacted through newspaper advertisements and different clubs and  associations that had a high probability of having healthy elderly members (e.g., alpine clubs,  sports clubs) and through personal contacts of collaborators of the study organization.     a personal history of each subject  was taken, anthropometric measurements were performed,  and fasting venous blood was drawn into s-monovette tubes (sarstedt, sevelen, switzerland).   of the 1,470 participants, 179 with high total leukocyte count (>11.5 g/l) and/or high c- reactive protein levels (>5 mg/l) were excluded from further analysis since such laboratory  cutoffs are strong indicators of the presence of systemic inflammation, mostly for upper  respiratory tract infections. of the remaining 1291 subjects, 558 were between 60-69 yrs old,  498 between 70-79 yrs old and 235 were ≥ 80 yrs old (table 1).     this study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of  helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. ethical approval for the  present study was obtained from the berner kantonal ethics committee (kek-berne-study  nr 166/08), bern, switzerland.      


8/22      laboratory testing  all assays were done at our institution. for 25(oh)d concentration measurements, we used  the lachrom elite apparatus provided by hitachi (hitachi medical systems europe, zug,  switzerland).  25(oh)d2 and 25(oh)d3 (derived from cholecalciferol) were distinguishable  using this method; for this study, only the latter more stable animal-origin 25(oh)d3 levels  are reported. the us national institute of standards and technology (nist) calibration  standard reference material (www.nist.gov) was consistently followed with each test batch,  and only the values complying with the requirements were released; the inter-and intra-assay  variations were < 5%. the baseline total 25(oh)d levels were categorized as normal,  insufficient, deficient, and severely deficient using levels adapted from the definitions  proposed earlier[17, 24]. the  immulite 2000 assay was used for quantification of serum  1-84 parathyroid hormone (pth);  this  is a solid-phase two-site chemiluminescent  immunoassay with a monoclonal mouse capture antibody and a polyclonal goat signal  antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase.  the levels of immunoglobulins, where applicable, were measured using the bn prospec®  nephelometry system (siemens, zurich, switzerland), incorporating stabilized human serum  as the n protein standard sl. subclass-specific sheep anti-human igg1 and igg2 were used  in conventional nephelometry and anti-human igg3 and igg4 in this system is loaded on  polystyrol particles to enhance sensitivity for quantitation of the cognate subclass. for c3 und  c4, we used sodium azide preserved anti-c3c antibodies < 6.4 mg/ml and anti-c4 < 5.4  mg/ml. the company recommends application of the following reference intervals established  with serum and/or plasma samples from  healthy adults: c3/c3c of 0.9 – 1.8 mg/ml and  c4/c4c of 01.-0.4 mg/ml. 


9/22    statistical procedures  the serum concentration values of 25(oh)d, immunoglobulin classes, igg subclasses and  complements were statistically analyzed using spss version 17.0 for microsoft windows  (spss, inc., chicago, il). all statistical analyses were based on two sided hypothesis tests  with a significance level of p < 0.05. kruskal-wallis test was used to test for statistically  significant associations of 25(oh)d and immunoglobulins in more than two groups. further,  the mann-whitney rank sum was used to statistically compare the levels of various  immunoglobulins and complement components by categories of 25(oh)d levels (normal,  insufficient, and deficiency groups). univariate linear regression analysis was used to  examine the relationship between 25(oh)d as the dependent variable and age,  immunoglobulin and complement components as the independent variables. 


10/22  results   the entire cohort of 1291 people studied revealed a significant correlation between aging and  25(oh)d levels (figure 1a). to analyze in detail the effect of aging on 25(oh)d,  participants were divided into three age groups (60-69 years , 70-79 years and >80 years)  (figure 1b). only 26.1% of the subjects had normal 25(oh)d levels (>30ng/ml). these  consisted of 21% of the males and 30.5% of the female participants of total study population.  the detailed distribution of the subjects into the respective 25(oh)d deficiency groups is  presented in table 1. severe 25(oh)d deficiencies (levels < 10 ng/ml) were observed  in  8.0% (m: 8.0%, f: 8.0%) of the subjects. however, it should be noted that subjects became  increasingly 25(oh)d deficient with increasing age, with a prevalence of severe deficiency  3.5%, 8.5%, and 16.3%  in women and 4.4%, 10.1%, and 13.0% in men in the progressively  older age groups (table 1). about 50% of the healthy elderly swiss over 70 years have  insufficient 25(oh)d levels. serum pth levels inversely correlated with 25(oh)d )  (p<0.001) (table 2). 25(oh)d levels were significantly different according to the month the  samples were collected (p<0.001) (additional file 1).    we also evaluated the relationship between 25(oh)d levels and major humoral components  of innate and acquired immunity. while levels of iga inversely correlated to 25(oh)d, igm  nor of total igg or ige differed from changing 25(oh)d levels (figure 2 and table 2).   the p values were obtained either using kruskal wallis analysis across the board for trend or  by comparing the 25(oh)d severely deficient and the normal group.  the mean serum level of igg2 significantly differed among  25(oh)d level groups (table 2).   further, complement component c4 increased with increasing 25(oh)d (figure 3 a & b),   whereas complement component c3 decreased with increasing  25(oh)d (figure 3 c & d).   seasonal variation in immunoglobulin levels and complement components revealed  differences according to the month samples were taken (additional file 2). significant 


11/22  differences were observed for total igg (p=0.001), igg2 (p=0.003), igg4 (p=0.04),  complement component c4 (p=0.01), and complement component c3 (p=0.006). total igg,  igg2, and igg4 peaked together with 25(oh)d during august.        discussion    this is the first time, that the 25(oh)d status is confronted to humoral immunity features in  healthy elderly subjects not receiving any real-time medical care; in fact, most studies  reporting insufficient/deficient 25(oh)d levels have been performed in the context of disease,  such as patients assigned to primary care [25], with (risk for) bone fractures [26], prostate  cancer [27], cardiovascular disease [28], and evaluations in response to influenza or  recombinant hepatitis b vaccine [29, 30]. some authors have questioned the quality of such  studies, mainly for technical reasons [31]. our study is in line with recent epidemiological  investigations demonstrating a high prevalence of mild and severe 25(oh)d deficiency; in  one of such studies, this deficiency did not significantly increase with aging [32], whereas it  did in another [33].    here, a majority (over 50%) of the elderly subjectively healthy swiss population presented  with 25(oh)d insufficiency/deficiency.  we observed a progressive decline in 25(oh)d  levels with aging both in women and men, most likely due to lower sunlight exposure and  decline in balanced food composition for those not (yet) part of homes for retired elderly, as  those under study here. in the osteoporotic fractures in men study (mros) from north  america, 31% of men aged 80-84 yrs had levels < 20 mg/ml [33], and the proportion  increased to 40% in those >85 yrs [33].  it can be assumed that vitamin d insufficiency  causes a substantial burden of disease (e.g., falls, osteoporosis, arterial stiffness [34], 


12/22  cardiovascular diseases [21], autoimmune disease, infectious disease, and neoplasia that  would classify insufficiency as a risk factor in our subjects rather than a past event.    in conjunction with these new insights, 25(oh)d testing requests received by medical  analytical laboratories are surging worldwide [35]. the present study was performed in  compliance with current good laboratory practice, glp. the cutoffs for normal, insufficient,  or (severely) deficient levels of vitamin d are defined at different levels based on an original  proposal [36]. currently, the deficiency decision limit of vitamin d levels is set by an  international agreement < 20 ng/ml, although this cutoff is not recognized by all [18, 24].  here we considered values < 10 ng/ml as indicative of severe deficiency. since the separation  into 4 different effectual groups cannot not relate to clinical features in the healthy elderly  studied, the cutoffs for 25(oh)d levels do not  target risk viz. no risk considerations [37].     depending on latitude and climate, seasonal/monthly variations serum levels of 25(oh) do  occur [33] or remain similar[38] and in the cohort under study here did vary,  reflected by  incremental levels towards end of summer/fall. to the best of our knowledge, it is the first  time that we here report a seasonal variation of humoral immunity components more or less  consistently with 25(oh)d levels.  25(oh)d insufficiency might also occur in  deliberately  sunny environment  [38] . the variations of levels in humoral immunity components along  the year observed in our study  might depend on changes in the microbiological mosaic  offending us with gram positive bacteria [39] or else influenza h1n1 [40], examples of the  most recently studied pathogens eliciting differential humoral immune responses. in the light  of the here found interdependency 25/oh)d/humoral immunity, vitamin d supplementation  therefore must be considered the whole year round on an individual risk/efficiency basis. a  recent update of circannual fluctuation of 25(oh)d in 50 kidney transplant recipients found  that (i) summer/winter peak-to-peak variations occur in our latitudes with ensuing  (ii) an 


13/22  increased frequency of 25(oh)d insufficiency during winter time [41]; this finding contrasts  somewhat to  recent reports from israel [38] and south africa [42].    to establish reference intervals (ris), different statistical procedures are commonly applied at  each step. the sample size in the >80-yr group of the present study exceeds the  100- observation barrier. indeed, the significant p-values produced by the ssps analysis under  non-parametric conditions highlight the findings that incremental insufficiency progresses to  deficiency with increasing age, a finding not taken into account by the endocrine society’s  clinical guidelines [24].    the ability of vitamin d to influence normal human immunity is highly dependent on the  25(oh)d status of individuals, and may lead to aberrant response to infection or  autoimmunity in those with insufficient vitamin d. this article describes some of the recent  developments with respect to vitamin d and the immune system, and possible clinical  implications. the influence that 1,25(oh) vitamin d exerts on the immune system sparks  interest for its potential for reducing infections and preventing allograft rejection after  transplantation [43].     beyond the risk for rickets and osteoporosis, other diseases are increasingly being noticed for  their association with vitamin d status [44]. therefore, we were interested in the recently  suggested role of vitamin d and its active metabolite 1,25 (oh)2d3 in modulating immune  responses [11, 45, 46]. specific cell types involved in the immune response express the  enzyme cyp27b1, which produces 1,25(oh)2d3 in situ [47]. recent studies suggest a role of  vitamin d in the reduction in the proliferation of immune cells, their maturation to plasma  cells and their production of immunoglobulin [6]. furthermore, 25(oh)d and human igg  levels have been directly linked in recent reports [15]. a potential explanation for the 


14/22  significant relationship between iga, igg2 and vitamin d discovered in the present study  could be explained by the recently suggested interplay between innate and adaptive immunity  and the role of t-cell cytokines and cytokine signaling  [48, 49], which also might explain the  dependency of 25(oh)d levels and c4 and c3.  in fact, interferon-γ potentiation of toll-like  receptor–induced antimicrobial peptides is associated with cyp27b1 activity that leads to  enhanced bioconversion of 25d3 to 1,25d3 in the vitamin d-dependent antimicrobial pathway  [50].    in vitro, the effects of 1,25(oh)2d3 on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production by  pbmcs are pleiotropic [51]. total serum igg levels were previously reported to have a  negative association with serum 25(oh)d [15], although such association was not present in  cerebrospinal fluid [52] nor in our study. low levels of 25(oh)d are thus a finding occurring  in healthy elderly and might have an impact on immune defense. 


15/22    conclusions  the majority (~2/3) of healthy elderly swiss subjects presents with vitamin d insufficiency.  with impacts on serum concentrations of igg1, igg2, iga and complement, more so in  severe cases of vitamin d deficiency, but also with insufficiency of 25(oh)d, this study  supports a role of vitamin d in the immune system under  immunocompetent conditions.    competing interests  the authors declare no competing interests. none of the authors has had in the past 12 months  any financial relationship with a biotechnology manufacturer, a pharmaceutical company, or  other commercial entity that has any interest in the subject matter, materials, or processes  discussed in the manuscript.    authors’ contributions  un, lr and mr participated in the design of the study; bs, cn, zs, un and lr drafted the  manuscript and analyzed the data. bs, pm and cn performed the statistical analysis. all  authors read and approved the final manuscript.    acknowledgments  the authors acknowledge ms. martina fanzun, msc, for validating the 25(oh)d hplc  dosages. the study was financed by an in-house grant for applied research of  labormedizinisches zentrum dr. risch, liebefeld bei bern, switzerland.
