associated with fracture.10–12 a review investigating out- comes following hip fracture concluded that postinjury depressive symptoms are common and a strong pre- dictor of poor recovery in the elderly.11 it is likely that a bidirectional relationship between depression and fracture exists. recently, depression has been shown to precede fracture, possibly inﬂuenced by medication use and biological and lifestyle factors dysre- gulated in depression.13 moreover, depression has been shown to be a common response to chronic medical conditions that can, in turn, impact on symptom burden and treatment adherence and increase the risk of com- plications.14 given the high prevalence of depression and fracture in women, as well as the previously reported associations showing depression to precede fracture, the aim of this study was to investigate whether fracture is associated with subsequent depressive symp- toms in a study of age-matched fracture versus non- fracture cohorts. understanding such an association is important in providing integrated and effective treatment. methods participants this study included women participating in the geelong osteoporosis study (gos), who were recruited from the barwon statistical division (bsd) situated in south- eastern australia to investigate the epidemiology of osteoporosis and fracture.15 fracture cohort women identiﬁed from radiological reports as having sustained an incident fracture between february 1994 and february 1996 (n=1397), living in the bsd at the time of recruitment and aged 35 years and older were invited to participate in the fracture cohort of the gos.16 the process of fracture ascertainment from radiological reports has previously been validated.17 a total of 1082 women were eligible for participation, with 77.4% accepting initial involvement (n=832). those who participated in the 6-year follow-up (n=439) were sent a depression questionnaire, with a total of 296 returned (67%) and thus included in this study (median age 63 years, range 35–87 years). non-fracture cohort between 1994 and 1997 an age-stratiﬁed, random sample of women residing in the bsd was recruited from the commonwealth electoral rolls. the initial group totalled 1494 women (median age 54 years, range 20–94 years), with a participation rate of 77.1%.18 those eligible to participate in the 6-year follow-up (n=1275) were sent a depression questionnaire, with a total of 758 returned (60%). for this current study, 590 women aged 35 years and older (median age 59.3 years, range 35– 91 years) were included. measurements outcome variable symptoms of depression during the 12-month period, 2000–2001, were identiﬁed using a self-report question- naire based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition criteria.19 an episode of major depression was deﬁned as a depressed mood state and a loss of interest and pleasure in usual activity lasting for at least a 2-week period. in addition, the pres- ence of at least four symptoms including weight change, sleep disturbance, psychomotor changes, fatigue, feel- ings of worthlessness, poor concentration and suicidal ideation had to be evident, accompanied by diminished physical performance determined to be causing distress or impairment in at least one domain of work, social or personal functioning. the cronbach’s α coefﬁcient for determining internal reliability of the questionnaire was 0.895.20 exposure variables body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. information on lifestyle and other health factors was obtained via self-report questionnaire. women were classed as physically active if they participated in light to vigorous activity on a regular basis. tobacco smoking was recognised if practised cur- rently, and alcohol use recognised if average consump- tion exceeded two standard drinks per day. statistical analyses statistical analyses were completed using minitab (v.15; minitab, state college, pennsylvania, usa). associations between fracture and depression differed for younger and older women; thus, all analyses were stratiﬁed by age (≤65 years and >65 years). differences in characteristics between those with fracture and those without fracture according to age group were compared using student t tests for continuous parametric data, mann-whitney for continuous non-parametric and χ2 analyses for categorical data. logistic regression was used to determine the associ- ation between fracture and the likelihood of depressive symptoms among the younger (≤65 years) and older (>65) women. age, anthropometry, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use were tested in the models as potential confounders and/or effect modiﬁers. values of p<0·05 were considered as signiﬁcant. results a total of 296 women with fracture (12 hip, 48 vertebral, 91 wrist/forearm, 17 upper arm, 7 pelvis, 11 rib, 62 lower leg and 48 other fractures) and 590 women without fracture were included in the analyses. characteristics of the women with fracture versus those without fracture according to age are shown in table 1. 2 williams lj, berk m, henry mj, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004226. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004226 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


younger women (≤65 years) among the younger women (n=552), there were no dif- ferences in weight, height, depression, physical activity or alcohol consumption between those with and those without fracture, however women with fracture were older and more likely to smoke (table 1). the association between fracture and depression among younger women was not signiﬁcant. the unadjusted odds of having depression following fracture was 0.60 (95% ci 0.34 to 1.06, p=0.08) compared with those without fracture. adjustment for age and weight did not affect the relationship (or=0.62, 95% ci 0.35 to 1.11, p=0.12), nor did further adjustment for height, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. older women (>65 years) among the older women (n=334), no differences in weight, height, physical activity, alcohol or smoking status were evident between those with or without frac- ture; however, women with fracture were younger and more likely to have depression (table 1). the odds of having depression following fracture was three times greater (or 3.02, 95% ci 1.16 to 7.89, p=0.02) for women with fracture compared with those without. adjusting for age and weight did not affect the relationship (or=3.33, 95% ci 1.24 to 8.98, p=0.02), which was also sus- tained after further adjustment for height, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. discussion the ﬁndings from this study indicate an association between fracture and depression, although only among older women. those aged >65 years were up to three times more likely to have depression post-fracture, while this relationship was not evident for younger women (≤65 years). these associations were independent of age, anthropometry and lifestyle factors. our ﬁndings suggesting the risk of depression postfrac- ture is increased among older women are consistent with ﬁndings from previous studies. recently, several publica- tions have explored health outcomes following hip frac- ture surgery and found depression to be common and to impact negatively on recovery up to 2 years postfrac- ture.21–23 a systematic review that investigated the preva- lence of psychiatric illness in hip fracture patients found that the prevalence of depression following fracture ranged from 9% to 47%24; those rates being somewhat higher than community rates. similarly, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was reported to be greater for women who also had prevalent vertebral fractures compared with those without.25 both depressive symptoms following frac- ture and preinjury mood state have been shown to be pre- dictive of recovery in the elderly, while a failure to regain preinjury functional and ability levels increases the possi- bility of persistent depressive symptomatology.10 26 in a prospective cohort study of 240 older participants, those who experienced high levels of depressive symptoms prior to a medical event (hip fracture, stroke and heart attack), had a poorer likelihood of recovery in activities of daily living.27 finally, a recent study using cultural models approach to understand how older women viewed osteoporosis reported that experiencing a fracture coincided with the acknowledgement of ‘getting older’.28 thus, we may expect a fracture to increase the likelihood of depression for some older women. it is plausible that stigma may be associated with a fracture in older age,28 and thus impact negatively on an older woman’s self- identity. taken in context, although a lower prevalence of depression overall has been reported among older women,3 the occurrence of a fracture may enhance the susceptibility to depression for a variety of reasons. table 1 characteristics of the fracture versus non-fracture cohorts according to age (≤65 years and >65 years) women with fracture women without fracture p values ≤65 years n=170 n=382 age (year) 54.0 (45.0–60.2) 50.6 (43.2–58.5) 0.019 weight (kg) 69.1 (61.4–78.4) 67.6 (60.1–79.0) 0.386 height (cm) 162.2±6.5 161.9±5.9 0.619 depression (12 months) 17 (10.0%) 60 (15.7%) 0.074 physical activity (active) 117 (79.6%) 275 (75.6%) 0.328 alcohol consumption (current) 77 (52.4%) 198 (54.4%) 0.679 smoking (current) 20 (26.7%) 40 (11.0%) <0.001 >65 years n=126 n=208 age (year) 72.2 (69.2–76.4) 74.1 (70.3–81.0) 0.002 weight (kg) 64.7 (57.0–70.6) 63.7 (56.0–71.9) 0.736 height (cm) 157.21±6.3 156.7±6.4 0.502 depression (12 months) 12 (9.5%) 7 (3.4%) 0.019 physical activity (active) 48 (45.7%) 78 (50.0%) 0.497 alcohol consumption (current) 40 (38.1%) 69 (44.2%) 0.324 smoking (current) 3 (5.3%) 3 (1.9%) 0.192 values are given as median (iqr), mean (±sd) or n (%) williams lj, berk m, henry mj, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004226. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004226 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


our ﬁndings suggest no relationship between fracture and later depression among younger women. it is plaus- ible that the causal pathway to fracture may differ across age groups, resulting in differing effects on psychological and physical outcomes. for instance, an internal locus of control (the belief one can control one’s own life), high self-esteem, hope, acceptance, optimism and a sense of mastery have all been associated with resilience or the ability to maintain or regain mental health following adversity.29 furthermore, differences in premorbid emo- tional and cognitive state may have existed between the younger and older women prior to fracture. this is an important factor, as high positive affect and motivation has been observed as increasing the chances of returning to premorbid levels of functioning after a major health event.27 finally, compared with older women, younger women may have more access to social networks on which they can draw on for support, be less likely to remain homebound postfracture, and be able to fulﬁl ongoing work and social commitments during recovery.30–32 some methodological issues should be considered when interpreting the study ﬁndings. the time lag between frac- ture and depression measurement and an inability to provide pre-event psychiatric status is a limitation and it has to be taken into consideration that depression is a long- term, recurrent disorder in most individuals.33 thus, it is likely that depression preceded fracture in at least some of the women. the use of a self-report instrument, rather than a clinical diagnostic interview must also be acknowledged, also sensitivity and speciﬁcity of this scale was not deter- mined. response bias may also have inﬂuenced the ﬁnd- ings, with higher rates of psychopathology and other comorbid conditions possibly present in the population declining participation. last, as with all observational studies, our results could be biased by unrecognised con- founders and may not be generalisable to other populations of women, men or those with other medical conditions. to our knowledge, there are no published studies investigating postfracture depression among the younger, fracture sites other than the hip, or studies with longer follow-up periods; these are all strengths of the current study. conclusion in conclusion, this study demonstrated that differences in mood status exist between older and younger women following fracture and that fracture is associated with increased depression in older women. assessment of mood status in both the short term and long term fol- lowing fracture in the elderly seems justiﬁed, with early detection and treatment of elevated levels of depression likely to result in improved outcomes. further research investigating a causal link between fracture and depres- sion is warranted and is currently underway. author affiliations 1impact strategic research centre, school of medicine, deakin university, geelong, victoria, australia 2department of psychiatry, the university of melbourne, parkville, australia 3orygen youth health research centre, parkville, australia 4florey institute of neuroscience and mental health, parkville, australia 5department of medicine, barwon health, deakin university, geelong, victoria, australia 6department of medicine, northwest academic centre, the university of melbourne, st albans, australia 7australian institute for musculoskeletal science, melbourne, australia contributors ljw took part in the conception and design of the study, data cleaning, statistical analysis, interpretation of the data and took primary responsibility for writing the manuscript. mb and slb took part in the interpretation of data and critically revised the manuscript. mjh and als took part in the conception and design of the study, statistical analysis, interpretation of the data and critically revised the manuscript. fnj took part in the conception and design of the study, acquisition of the data and critically revised the manuscript. jap took part in the conception and design of the study, interpretation of the analysis and critically revised the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript. funding this work was supported by the national health and medical research council (nhmrc) of australia. ljw is supported by a nhmrc career development fellowship, mb is supported by a nhmrc senior principal research fellowship and slb is supported by a nhmrc early career fellowship. competing interests ljw has received grant/research support from eli lilly, pfizer, the university of melbourne, deakin university and the nhmrc. mb has received grant/research support from the nih, simons foundation, crc for mental health, stanley medical research institute, mbf, nhmrc, beyond blue, geelong medical research foundation, bristol-myers squibb, eli lilly, glaxosmithkline, organon, novartis, mayne pharma, servier and astrazeneca. he has been a paid consultant for astrazeneca, bristol-myers squibb, eli lilly, glaxosmithkline, janssen cilag, lundbeck and pfizer and a paid speaker for astrazeneca, bristol-myers squibb, eli lilly, glaxosmithkline, janssen cilag, lundbeck, organon, pfizer, sanofi-synthelabo, solvay and wyeth. slb has received grant/research support from the university of melbourne, and the nhmrc. fnj has received grant/research support from the brain and behaviour research institute, nhmrc, australian rotary health, geelong medical research foundation and the university of melbourne, and has been a paid speaker for sanofi-synthelabo, janssen cilag, servier, pfizer, network nutrition, health ed and eli lilly. jap has received speaker fees from amgen, eli lilly and sanofi-aventis and funding from the geelong region medical research foundation, barwon health, perpetual trustees, the dairy research and development corporation, the university of melbourne, the ronald geoffrey arnott foundation, anz charitable trust, the american society for bone and mineral research, amgen (europe) gmbh and the nhmrc. patient consent obtained. ethics approval human research ethics committee at barwon health. provenance and peer review not commissioned;
