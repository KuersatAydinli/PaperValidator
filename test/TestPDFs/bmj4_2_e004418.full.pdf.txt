dysfunction, left atrial enlargement, arrhythmia duration and history of hypertension are major risk factors for af recurrence.6 however, recent studies have indicated that inﬂammation, necrosis and ﬁbrosis play roles in the struc- tural remodelling process of the atria, contributing to the perpetuation or recurrence of af. c-reactive protein (crp) is an acute-phase reactant whose levels increase in response to proinﬂammatory cyto- kines, notably interleukin-6, and other endogenous signals of innate immunity or tissue damage. crp has recently been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk and af recurrence. a previous meta-analysis revealed that crp is elevated in patients with af.7 however, ﬁve of the six studies included in that analysis used traditional auto- mated immunonephelometric assays to measure crp. unfortunately, those assays are insufﬁciently sensitive for measuring the low level of inﬂammation associated with af. a newer enzyme immunoassay, namely high-sensitivity crp (hs-crp), is capable of measuring serum crp below 0.6 mg/dl and may further enhance the predictability of af recurrence.8 since 2006, several studies evaluating the accuracy of hs-crp in predicting af recurrence have been published,9–19 warranting a systemic and quantitative summary of current evidence on the accuracy of crp in predicting af recurrence after cardioversion. methods identification of studies general bibliographic databases (medline and embase) were searched from inception to april 2013. the medical subject heading (mesh) and text words for the term c-reactive protein were combined with the mesh term ‘diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation’. the search was limited to human studies with no language restric- tions. in addition to the electronic search, reference lists in all known reviews and primary studies were checked manually. selection criteria this review focused on observational studies in which the measurements of serum crp were used to predict af recurrence. the population of interest comprised patients with paroxysmal or persistent af who under- went electric cardioversion, ablation therapy or pharma- cological cardioversion. af recurrence was deﬁned as af documented by ecg at any time after the cardiover- sion during the follow-up period. generally, patients were instructed to return to the clinic if the symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath or chest discom- fort developed after cardioversion. we included studies using a cohort design or case–control design with appro- priate controls. two reviewers independently assessed eli- gible articles for inclusion. disagreements were initially resolved by consensus and using arbitration by a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached by the two reviewers. we extracted data from the included studies. data collected include study design, participants, country, period of recruitment, hs-crp assay, cut-off points, length of follow-up period and recurrence of af. one reviewer extracted the data and a second reviewer independently veriﬁed the correctness of the extracted data. quality assessment we assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies using a well validated tool for assessment of quality of diagnostic accuracy studies (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies, quadas).20 the quadas instrument scrutinises characteristics of study designs, population, index tests and reference stan- dards that may be associated with risk of bias. these fea- tures included the spectrum of patients, whether index tests and reference standards were evaluated and inter- preted independently to avoid incorporation bias, and whether all patients underwent the same reference stan- dards to avoid differential or partial veriﬁcation bias. data abstraction one reviewer independently extracted the data and a second reviewer independently veriﬁed the data. extracted data comprised the following: overall study characteristics (including the ﬁrst author, country, lan- guage and date of publication); patient characteristics (including age range and pre-existing af); quantitative data required for construction of a 2×2 table (including number of participants, sensitivity, speciﬁcity and recur- rence case number; see online supplementary table); information regarding the hs-crp assay (including brand name of the test kit, cut-off levels and quantitative or semi-quantitative nature of the test); and study set- tings. in studies that reported multiple pairs of sensitivity and speciﬁcity data, we consistently used the data with the highest youden index (sensitivity+speciﬁcity−1) and performed a sensitivity analysis at a later stage. quantitative data synthesis we performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy of crp testing for the prediction of recurrent af. we calculated the pooled sensitivity and speciﬁcity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the diagnostic or of crp, along with the respective 95% cis, using a bivariate meta-analysis model.21 likelihood ratios were then trans- lated to post-test probability by use of fagan’s plot. we constructed a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve that plots sensitivity versus speciﬁcity and calculated the area under the curve.22 we evaluated the degree of between-study heterogeneity by using the i2 test.23 to explore the clinical sources of heterogeneity, we deﬁned the potential explanatory variables a priori and performed subgroup analysis to see if the accuracy estimates changed signiﬁcantly across various subgroups. the presence and the effect of publication bias were examined using a combination of the egger tests.24 statistical analyses were conducted using stata v.11.0, notably with the user-written ‘midas’ and ‘metandi’ 2 yo c-h, lee s-h, chang s-s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004418. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004418 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


programs. all statistical tests were two-sided and statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0.05. search results and study characteristics the ﬂow of inclusion and exclusion is summarised in ﬁgure 1. using our search criteria, we identiﬁed 784 studies, of which 352 were from pubmed and 432 were from embase. a total of 752 citations were excluded based on predeﬁned criteria. no additional citations were identiﬁed from the reference lists. a total of 32 articles were retrieved for full-text review, and 23 were excluded due to various reasons detailed in ﬁgure 1. a total of nine studies that evaluated the accuracy of hs-crp tests in predicting af recurrence after cardiover- sion were ﬁnally included in the meta-analysis. the nine studies included a total of 682 patients with af after suc- cessful cardioversion, of which 347 (50.9%) developed recurrence. characteristics of included studies table 1 lists the study and population characteristics of the nine patient populations, excluding ﬁve studies that do not have sufﬁcient data for statistical ana- lysis.25–29 the mean age of patients in the included studies ranged from 55.1 to 67.9 years and the mean follow-up period ranged from 30 days to 1 year. seven studies included patients with persistent af, while two studies included patients with paroxysmal af. seven studies used electric shock, one used circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (also known as electric abla- tion) and the other used intravenous amiodarone as the primary method for cardioversion. a total of seven studies provided multivariate (adjusted) ors to evalu- ate the independent predictive value of crp levels. these studies generally adjusted for potential predic- tors of af recurrence such as age, sex, use of antiar- rhythmic agents, and heart structural and functional parameters. all studies showed that crp was a signiﬁ- cant independent predictor of af recurrence. associated adjusted ratios and adjusted variables are summarised in table 1. quality assessment results of the quality assessment of studies of diagnos- tic accuracy are summarised in ﬁgure 2. all studies were prospective and enrolled consecutive outpatients with af after cardioversion. three studies had a short follow-up period (ie, ≤0.5 or 1 year). although most of the studies did not indicate whether physicians were blinded to the index tests when diagnosing af recur- rence, the determination of af recurrence was not affected by the knowledge of hs-crp test results and risk of incorporation bias was minimal. none of the studies reported the undetermined results or withdrawals. figure 1 a simplified flow chart to identify and to include studies. among 752 citations in medline and embase from inception to december 2013, a search limited to human studies using ‘c-reactive protein’ and the medical subject heading (mesh) term ‘diagnosis of atrial fibrillation’ resulted in 32 potentially relevant articles for further review. after careful scrutinisation on full text, nine articles were left for meta-analysis. yo c-h, lee s-h, chang s-s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004418. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004418 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

diagnostic accuracy indices sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic or the estimated sensitivity and speciﬁcity were relatively consistent across studies (i2=14.6%). table 2 shows the results of individual and combined sensitivity estimates for the tests. the estimated pooled sensitivity and speciﬁ- city for hs-crp were 71.0% (95% ci 63% to 78%) and 72.0% (61% to 81%), respectively. the pooled preva- lence of af recurrence was 54% herein, and we used it as the pre-test probability. with a pooled positive likeli- hood ratio of 2.57 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.4, the post-test probability for af recurrence for a positive hs-crp test result was 72% and a post-test probability for a negative hs-crp test result was 29%. the area under the receiver operating curve showed an acceptable overall measurement of discrimination (0.77, ﬁgure 3). figure 4 shows the forest plot of the ors. subgroup analysis and meta-regression in view of the potential inﬂuence of spectrum variability, we considered the duration of follow-up, mode of cardi- oversion and type of af in the study patients to be important. hs-crp test results generally had higher sen- sitivity and lower speciﬁcity in predicting long-term over short-term af recurrence. excluding two studies not using electric shock as the primary cardioversion method did not signiﬁcantly alter the predictive accur- acy. similarly, focusing the study patients on persistent af population had similar results as compared with the main overall analysis. exploratory meta-regression analysis did not ﬁnd that any pre-speciﬁed covariate signiﬁcantly changed the effect estimate. discussion this meta-analysis shows that elevated crp levels are independently predictive of af recurrence in patients with persistent or paroxysmal af who have undergone successful cardioversion. this ﬁnding supports that measurement of crp levels before cardioversion can aid in the prediction of af recurrence. despite the modest pooled sensitivity and speciﬁcity, the rule-in diagnostic value was still high, given the high recur- rence rate of af observed in these included studies. a positive hs-crp test result at baseline can predict a 73% chance of af recurrence in the 6–12 months fol- lowing cardioversion. previous studies have examined risk factors that predict af recurrence. traditional clinical risk factors for recurrence include history of multiple af episodes, use of diuretic treatment, higher chads-2 (congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, age≥75 years, dia- betes mellitus, and past history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack doubled) index score, and frequent use of amiodarone, calcium-channel blockers, class 1c drugs and digitalis.30 31 although each of these factors could predict af recurrence with some accuracy, a quantitative combination of these predictors is not available, and the clinical utility of these variables remains questionable. this also suggests that a multivariate prediction model should be developed for af recurrence, and that hs-crp should be a candidate for inclusion in the model. during the past decade, serum biomarkers have emerged as practical tools to help in the early identiﬁ- cation of patients at high risk for various cardiac events. elevation of inﬂammatory markers is associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure or coronary artery disease, and onset of ventricular arrhythmia.32–35 of note, there is abundant evidence that elevated serum levels of crp are associated with the genesis and perpetuation of af. crp is the most commonly used clinical inﬂammatory biomarker. it is mainly produced in liver and by inﬂammatory cells in figure 2 the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy on studies. a spectrum of features were analysed to avoid bias using a well validated tool, quality assessment of diagnostics accuracy studies (quadas). percentage for each feature was independently evaluated among the studies. it is worthy of attention that none of the studies explained the withdrawal and reported undetermined results, likely to compromise the quality of diagnostic accuracy. yo c-h, lee s-h, chang s-s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004418. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004418 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


response to proinﬂammatory cytokine stimulation. although the pathophysiology of af remains elusive, there is pathophysiological evidence supporting the role of inﬂammation in the initiation, maintenance and perpetuation of af.36 clinically, af is frequently associated with local inﬂammatory diseases such as myocarditis or pericarditis, and systemic inﬂammatory status, such as postoperative state and severe sepsis. histologically, structural remodelling of the atria mani- fested by loss of myocardium and increased atrial ﬁbro- sis is a hallmark of af.37 inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates and oxidative damage have been demonstrated in atrial biopsy specimens from af patients.38 activated inﬂam- matory cells in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, cytokines and growth factors, may ultimately lead to matrix deposition with atrial ﬁbrosis. recent evi- dence also shows that the uses of immune-modulating agents such as statins, ace inhibitors or glucocorticoids modulate the course of af.39 in addition to crp, b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) has been shown to be an indicator of new onset af and af recurrence after successful cardioversion.34 35 40 bnp is also produced in response to atrial pressure and volume overload and there is evidence that bnp is secreted by the atrium in patients with af. a previous meta-analysis showed that the standardised mean differ- ence in plasma bnp level between patients with non- recurrence and patients with recurrence was −1.35 (95% ci −2.17 to −0.53).41 data on sensitivity and speciﬁcity in that study were not available. the comparative accur- acy between bnp and hs-crp in predicting af recur- rence thus requires further analysis. there are both strengths and limitations in our study. considering the limitation of sensitivity and speciﬁcity in clinical interpretation, we reported summary likeli- hood ratios (lrs) as an ancillary measure of predictive accuracy. the lrs indicate how much a given crp testing result increases or decreases the probability of recurrence of af. post-test probabilities can be derived from pre-test probabilities and lrs, which are an important clinical parameter for major clinical decision making. second, we used a bivariate random effect model to account for the inherent negative correlation arising from different cut-off values used in different studies, and occurring between the logit true positive rates and false positive rate. third, we performed sensi- tivity analysis by restricting analysis within two broad cat- egories of follow-up duration. results of sensitivity analysis did not show a signiﬁcantly different overall predicative accuracy between long-term and short-term prediction of af recurrence. nonetheless, it is note- worthy that the sensitivity may be overestimated in our study under the hypothesis where the inﬂammation may be symptomatic since none of the studies provided withdrawal and undetermined results, and the ascertain- ment of af was passive. this event further introduces the differential veriﬁcation bias. moreover, our meta-analysis is restricted to distinguishing hs-crp levels ta bl e 2 s um m ar y of po ol ed di ag no st ic ac cu ra cy in di ce s v ar ia bl es n o. st ud ie s s en si tiv ity (9 5% c i) s pe ci fic ity (9 5% c i) li ke lih oo d ra tio + li ke lih oo d ra tio − a u r o c (9 5% c i) i2 (9 5% c i) d ia gn os tic o r (9 5% c i) m et a- re gr es si on p va lu e e gg er ’s te st p va lu e o ve ra ll1 0 1 2 – 1 9 9 0. 71 (0 .6 3 to 0. 78 ) 0. 72 (0 .6 1 to 0. 81 ) 2. 57 (1 .8 6 to 3. 55 ) 0. 40 (0 .3 2 to 0. 50 ) 0. 77 (0 .7 3 to 0. 81 ) 14 .6 (0 to 56 .6 ) 5. 91 (4 .0 7 to 8. 59 ) – 0. 56 6 fo llo w -u p tim e <6 m on th s1 0 1 4 1 6 1 9 4 0. 73 (0 .5 6 to 0. 85 ) 0. 71 (0 .5 4 to 0. 83 ) 2. 50 (1 .6 7 to 3. 77 ) 0. 38 (0 .2 4 to 0. 59 ) 0. 78 (0 .7 4 to 0. 82 ) 0. 0 (0 .0 to 74 .6 ) 6. 34 (3 .7 0 to 10 .8 5) 0. 75 9 0. 34 5 fo llo w -u p tim e >1 ye ar 1 2 – 1 4 1 7 1 8 5 0. 77 (0 .6 9 to 0. 84 ) 0. 65 (0 .4 5 to 0. 80 ) 2. 22 (3 .1 4 to 12 .8 8) 0. 35 (0 .2 6 to 0. 48 ) 0. 79 (0 .7 5 to 0. 82 ) 34 .8 (0 .0 to 77 .2 ) 5. 54 (3 .2 9 to 9. 32 ) 0. 55 2 0. 58 3 e le ct ric ca rd io ve rs io n1 0 1 2 1 4 – 1 6 1 8 1 9 7 0. 72 (0 .6 2 to 0. 80 ) 0. 74 (0 .6 0 to 0. 85 ) 2. 81 (1 .7 9 to 4. 41 ) 0. 38 (0 .2 9 to 0. 50 ) 0. 78 (0 .7 5 to 0. 82 ) 33 .0 (0 .0 to 71 .6 ) 5. 13 (3 .6 3 to 7. 25 ) 0. 61 1 0. 19 8 p er si st en ta f 1 0 1 2 1 4 – 1 6 1 8 1 9 7 0. 70 (0 .6 1 to 0. 78 ) 0. 71 (0 .5 9 to 0. 80 ) 2. 40 (1 .7 7 to 3. 25 ) 0. 42 (0 .3 3 to 0. 53 ) 0. 76 (0 .7 2 to 0. 80 ) 22 .3 (0 .0 to 64 .2 ) 5. 70 (3 .7 7 to 8. 62 ) 0. 89 9 0. 46 4 a f, at ria lf ib ril la tio n; a u r o c ,a re a un de r re ce iv er op er at in g ch ar ac te ris tic cu rv e. 6 yo c-h, lee s-h, chang s-s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004418. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004418 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


above or below 0.6 mg/dl because the authors in only one of the studies claimed to possess such capability. finally, due to the lack of individual data, it is hard to determine whether the area under the receiver operating curve can be improved by the new assay either on overall or on individual studies. in general, potential sources of between-study variability included differences in incidence of af recurrence, different threshold values of crp concentration used and differ- ent duration for follow-up. another limitation was the strategy we used to determine the optimal cut-off value. most studies determined an optimal cut-off value to maximise both sensitivity and speciﬁcity. although a single cut-off value is straightforward in clinical inter- pretation, it may make a marker neither sensitive nor speciﬁc enough to rule out or rule in an outcome of interest. a two cut-off value strategy, with one using a lower cut-off value to optimise the sensitivity (rule-out value) and the other using a higher cut-off value to optimise the speciﬁcity (rule-in value), would make better use of the information that a biomarker with a continuous value could provide. current summary esti- mates based on the one cut-off point may thus have under-evaluated the clinical usefulness of hs-crp assays. to make the best use of the biomarker information by adopting a two cut-off point strategy or a multi-cut-off point risk classiﬁcation strategy, an individual data meta-analysis would be needed to overcome the limita- tions of this aggregated data meta-analysis. conclusions baseline crp levels before cardioversion can independ- ently predict af recurrence after successful cardiover- sion. given the high recurrence rate reported in most series, the modest positive likelihood ratio for hs-crp assays still has high positive predictive value. future studies should focus on the evaluation of two or multiple cut-off points. in the interim, their inclusion in existing pre-cardioversion evaluation algorithms should be considered. figure 4 forest plot of the ors. our study indicates that high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) positive patients are ∼5.91 times more likely to develop a recurrence of atrial fibrillation than are hs-crp negative patients. the estimated sensitivity and specificity were relatively consistent across studies (i2=14.6%). figure 3 the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp). our analysis suggests it is highly possible to predict atrial fibrillation using c-creative protein since the area under the curve generates a measurement of discrimination ∼0.77. the overall sensitivity and specificity are relatively high. five out of nine studies fall in the 95% ci region, and eight out of nine in the 95% prediction region. yo c-h, lee s-h, chang s-s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004418. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004418 7 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from
