associated with increased abdominal obesity and related metabolic changes in a sample of healthy austrian adults. methods study population participants were recruited among employees in a ﬁnan- cial institution based in vienna. once a year the employ- ees undergo a health screening at the company. after information on the purpose of the study and its proce- dures, they were invited to participate. two days before the 2011 medical examination, they received a self- administered questionnaire, which was collected on the examination day. of the 1247 employees who ﬁlled in the questionnaires (participation rate: approximately 80%), 261 were subsequently excluded: those who reported a history of cancer (20) or thyroid dysfunction (37), missing information on gender (3), age (1), anthropometric measurements (67), smoking status (80) and health status (24), pregnant women (3), individuals under nicotine replacement therapy at the time of the study (4), those with a body mass index (bmi) lower than 18.5 kg/m2 or greater than 40 kg/m2 (20) and those with a waist circumference (wc) lower than 60 cm (3). data of 986 individuals (405 men and 581 women) aged 19–65 years were included in the ﬁnal analyses. all participants signed an informed consent form and the study protocol was in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. anthropometric measurements bmi was calculated as the ratio of weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m2). wc and hip circumferences (hc) were measured using a non-elastic ﬂexible tape, with participants in light clothing without shoes: wc at the top of the right iliac crest, at the end of a normal expiration; hc at the largest posterior extension of the buttocks.11 waist-to-hip ratio (whr) was calculated as wc/hc, waist-to-height ratio (whtr) as wc/height. lifestyle and education participants who answered “no” to the following ques- tions: “have you ever smoked daily?”, “have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes, cigar, pipes or other tobacco pro- ducts in your entire life?”, “do you smoke now?” were categorised as non-smokers. individuals who reported smoking at the time of enrolment or quitted less than 1 year before were classiﬁed as smokers. smokers included occasional (<1 cigarette per day) and daily smokers (≥1 cigarette per day). daily smokers were further subgrouped into light smokers (1–10 cigarettes per day), moderate smokers (11–20 cigarettes per day) and heavy smokers (>20 cigarettes per day). former smokers were deﬁned as individuals who used to smoke and quitted at least 1 year prior to their recruitment. information on physical activity was obtained by the short form of the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq).12 met-minutes per week were then calculated according to the ipaq scoring protocol, and participants were categorised into three pa levels: low, moderate and high.13 dietary intake of food and beverages was obtained by means of self-administered 24 h recalls, supported by instructions and a validated photographic manual14 describing portion sizes. education was classiﬁed as ‘low’ for compulsory educa- tion (9 years of schooling in austria), equivalent to levels 1 and 2 of the international standard classiﬁcation of education (isced), ‘middle’ for at least 3 years of add- itional schooling (isced levels 3 and 4) and ‘high’ for a university degree (isced levels 5 and 6). blood samples blood samples were taken by venipuncture after an over- night fast and collected into heparinised tubes. complete blood count was performed automatically (sysmex xt 2000i); fasting glucose (fg), total choles- terol (tc), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) and triacylglycerides (tag) were also analysed by auto- mated methods (roche modular, roche diagnostics, vienna, austria). plasma low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol (ldl-c) was calculated using the friedewald formula (ldl-c=tc—hdl-c—tag/5) for tag levels lower than 400 mg/dl.15 blood analyses were available for 88% of men and 91% of women. statistical analyses metric scaled variables are expressed as mean±sd. χ2 tests were used to compare frequency distributions of categorical variables. pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were used to characterise relationships between bmi and wc. for univariate analyses, factor levels were com- pared using the least signiﬁcant difference (lsd) post hoc procedure. multivariate analyses of variances (manova) were performed to evaluate the impact of smoking status or number of cigarettes on anthropometric and biochem- ical parameters. comparisons between non-smokers, smokers and former smokers were performed separately for men and women. smoking status and level of educa- tion were used as ﬁxed factors. in models where the number of cigarettes per day was used, gender was added as a ﬁxed factor. several general linear models were used to evaluate the inﬂuence of possible confounders in the results. the level of complexity was increased stepwise by adding speciﬁc variables such as age, physical activity level and total energy intake as covariates to the model. the result of the simplest model is presented, when p values remained unchanged after correcting for the different covariates. for all analyses a two-tailed p value less than 5% (p<0.05) was considered statistically signiﬁcant. all statis- tical analyses were performed using the ibm spss v.20 (spss inc, chicago, illinois, usa). 2 de oliveira fontes gasperin l, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004899. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-004899 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


in the linear regression models, ‘number of cigarettes’ was included as a categorical variable. when visual inspection indicated deviance from linearity, a general additive model using splines with 4 degrees of freedom for the number of cigarettes per day was tested. the latter analyses were performed with stata se v.12.1 (statacorp, college station, texas, usa). results smokers of both sexes were younger than non-smokers and former smokers. among men, the average ages of non-smokers, smokers and former smokers were 43±9.5, 38.3±10.8 and 45.9±8.2 years, respectively. differences between the three groups were statistically signiﬁcant (non-smokers vs smokers: p<0.001; non-smokers vs former smokers: p=0.016; smokers vs former smokers: p<0.001). among women, non-smokers, smokers and former smokers aged on average 40.5±8.7, 37.6±10.1 and 42.4 ±8.5 years, respectively. smokers differed signiﬁcantly from non-smokers (p=0.001) and former smokers (p<0.001). the baseline characteristics of the participants, according to gender and smoking status, are presented in table 1 for men and in table 2 for women. there were only few participants (ﬁve men and nine women) with a low level of education, and therefore the low and medium levels were combined. the anthropometric indices were highly correlated in men and women. among men, 67.4% of the variance in bmi was explained by wc (r=0.82, p<0.001). among women, 68.7% of the variance in bmi was accounted for by wc (r=0.83, p<0.001). in the whole sample (men and women together), pearson’s correlation between whr and bmi was r=0.46, between whtr and bmi was r=0.82, between whr and body weight was r=0.54, and between whtr and body weight was r=0.71 (p<0.001 for all correlations). among men and women, no statistically signiﬁcant dif- ferences were found between the three smoking groups regarding the anthropometric indices. the results did not change after excluding occasional smokers (<1 cigar- ette per day) from the group of smokers (data not shown). among men and women, fg, tc, ldl-c, ratio of tc to hdl-c and ldl-c did not differ signiﬁcantly between non-smokers, smokers and former smokers, after control- ling for age, physical activity and energy intake. among men, the total white cell counts (wccs) were signiﬁcantly elevated in smokers, compared with non- smokers (p<0.001) and former smokers (p<0.001). the table 1 baseline characteristics of male participants according to the smoking status non-smokers smokers former smokers p value sample size, n (%) 180 (44.4) 122 (30.1) 103 (25.4) age, years 43.0±9.5 38.3±10.8 45.9±9.2 0.032 height, cm 179.8±5.9 179±5.7 179±7.1 0.560* body weight, kg 81.3±10.9 81.5±11.9 83.7±11.2 0.777* bmi, kg/m2 25.1±3.0 25.3 ±3.3 26.1±3.5 0.634* wc, cm 92.2±9.5 92.1±10.1 94.6±9.4 0.911* hc, cm 99.0±7.4 98.6±7.2 99.7±7.6 0.895* whr 0.931±0.07 0.932±0.06 0.950±0.08 0.466* whtr 0.524±0.06 0.520±0.06 0.540±0.06 0.827* fasting glucose, mmol 4.6±0.6 4.5±1.0 4.6±0.5 0.217* total cholesterol, mmol 5.6±1.0 5.5±1.1 5.6±0.9 0.683* hdl-c, mmol 1.4±0.3 1.4±0.4 1.5±0.3 0.025* ldl-c, mmol 3.6±0.9 3.5±0.9 3.6±0.8 0.990* triacylglycerols, mmol 1.3±0.7 1.5±1.0 1.4±1.0 0.006* tc to hdl-c ratio 4.2±1.2 4.3±1.3 4.1±1.2 0.098* total wcc, g/l(a,b) 6.2±1.4 7.1±1.9 6.3±1.2 0.009* energy intake, kj 9306±2334 9402±1865 9411±2355 0.941† physical activity (%) low 33.5 33.0 29.1 0.902‡ medium 46.5 48.9 47.7 high 20.0 18.1 23.3 education level medium 56.9 77.0 74.5 <0.001‡ high 43.1 23.0 25.5 values are shown as mean±sd. *p value determined by multivariate anova and adjusted for age, physical activity and energy intake. †p value determined by multivariate anova and adjusted for age. lsd was the post hoc procedure.

differences between the groups remained statistically sig- niﬁcant after controlling for age, physical activity and energy intake (table 1). among women, the total wcc were signiﬁcantly higher in smokers, compared with non-smokers (p<0.001) and former smokers (p<0.001), and the dif- ferences remained signiﬁcant after controlling for con- founders. no differences in the total or differential wccs were found between female non-smokers and female former smokers (table 2). characteristics of daily smokers, according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day the mean±sd number of cigarettes per day was 6.3±3.3 for light smokers, 17.3±2.8 for moderate smokers and 28.8±5.5 for heavy smokers. the mean±sd ages of light smokers, moderate smokers and heavy smokers were 37±10.7, 39.3±10.2 and 43.8±7.4, respectively. heavy smokers were signiﬁcantly older than light smokers (p=0.023). no signiﬁcant dif- ferences in the average age at which participants started smoking were observed between the groups. however, they differed signiﬁcantly (p=0.020) regarding the years of smoking (light smokers: 18.9±9.8 years; moderate smokers: 21.8±9.9 years; heavy smokers: 24.7±7.3 years). the characteristics of daily smokers, according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day, are shown in table 3. in the unadjusted model, heavy smokers had signiﬁ- cantly greater values of body weight (p=0.030), bmi (p=0.003), wc (p=0.032) and hc (p=0.036) than light and moderate smokers. after controlling for age, phys- ical activity and energy intake, the signiﬁcance remained only for body weight (p=0.009) and bmi (p=0.023). overweight and obesity were observed in 84.6% of heavy smokers, compared with 35.6% of light smokers and 33% of moderate smokers (χ2=13.5, p=0.001). the results of the linear regression models for selected end points are shown in table 4 including also the impact of physical activity (low, moderate and high activity level), reported consumption of calories, educa- tion, age and gender. a non-linear association for the numbers of cigarettes was evident for body weight, tag, hdl-c and fg (ﬁgure 1) with strong adverse effects usually only seen in heavy smokers. discussion in the present study, no statistical differences in the mean values of body weight and bmi were found between non-smokers, smokers and former smokers. table 2 baseline characteristics of female participants according to the smoking status non-smokers smokers former smokers p value sample size, n (%) 276 (47.5) 181 (31.2) 124 (21.3) age, years 40.5±8.7 37.6±10.1 42.4±8.5 0.256 height, cm 166.8±5.7 166.3±6.0 167.6±5.7 0.246* body weight, kg 65.6±11.0 65.3±10.4 68.1±12.7 0.610* bmi, kg/m2 23.6±3.8 23.6±3.4 24.2±4.2 0.637* wc, cm 83.4±10.2 83.4±9.9 85.2±12.7 0.467* hc, cm 97.2±9.5 96.6±8.6 98.1±11.4 0.857* whr 0.858±0.06 0.863±0.06 0.867±0.06 0.332* whtr 0.494±0.06 0.499±0.06 0.505±0.08 0.374* fasting glucose, mmol 4.4±0.9 4.3±0.7 4.4±0.7 0.097* total cholesterol, mmol 5.5±1.0 5.4±1.0 5.4±0.9 0.318* hdl-c, mmol 1.8±0.4 1.7±0.4 1.8±0.4 0.177* ldl-c, mmol 3.2±0.9 3.3±0.9 3.2±0.8 0.510* triacylglycerols, mmol 1.0±0.4 1.1±0.6 1.0±0.4 0.448* tc to hdl-c ratio 3.1±0.8 3.5±1.1 3.2±0.8 0.083* total wcc, g/l(a,b) 6.4±1.5 7.7±2.1 6.3±1.8 <0.001* energy intake, kj 7647±1777 6989±1806 7383±1999 0.008† physical activity (%) low 33.3 26.5 24.2 0.019‡ medium 43.5 60.3 52.6 high 23.1 13.2 23.2 education level (%) medium 75.3 90 82.3 <0.001‡ high 24.7 10 17.1 values are shown as mean±sd. *p value determined by multivariate anova and adjusted for age, physical activity and energy intake. †p value determined by multivariate anova and adjusted for age. lsd was the post hoc procedure.

likewise, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the pat- terns of abdominal obesity—assessed by wc, whr or whtr—were found between three groups. however, among male participants, physical activity was found to be negatively and independently associated with body weight, bmi, wc, whr and whtr, after con- trolling for age, smoking and energy intake (data not shown). previous studies have also reported an inde- pendent association between activity scores and body fat distribution among european men, after adjustment for smoking.16 although several studies found that smokers have lower body weight and bmi than non-smokers,17 18 the results in the literature are inconclusive. our data are in accordance with those of previous studies which found no signiﬁcant differences between smokers and non- smokers regarding those anthropometric indices.19 20 different from other ﬁndings21–23 and in agreement with others,24 25 in our study smoking status was not sig- niﬁcantly associated with increased abdominal obesity. smoking cessation is often accompanied by weight gain, especially among heavy smokers.5 26 in the present study, former smokers were not found to have signiﬁ- cantly higher body weight or bmi than non-smokers or smokers. recent quitters in this study were not included among former smokers. so this study at least indicates that any weight gain after smoking cessation is not permanent. while smoking status per se had only little effect on anthropometric parameters, heavy smokers (>20 cigar- ettes per day) had signiﬁcantly higher values of body weight and bmi, compared with light (1–10 cigarettes per day) and moderate (11–20 cigarettes per day) smokers. the signiﬁcance remained even after control- ling for age, physical activity and energy intake. the possible explanations for a higher body weight/ bmi among heavy smokers, compared with light smokers, are differences in personality27 and some life- style characteristics28 that may increase their risk of becoming overweight and obese.29 they were reported to consume more alcohol, be less active and have a poorer diet, compared with light and moderate smokers.30 it is possible that the higher consumption of alcohol among heavy smokers leads to a weight gain which is not observed in light and moderate smokers.31 regarding the laboratory analyses, differences in the lipid proﬁle, according to the smoking status, were found only in men, after controlling for age, physical activity and energy intake. in women, although the ana- lyses were not controlled for menstrual cycle, controlling for the use of hormonal contraceptive or hormonal replacement therapy did not change the results (data not shown). male smokers presented higher levels of tag and lower levels of hdl-c. effects of smoking were generally more pronounced in heavy smokers. in add- ition, the levels of fg increased signiﬁcantly with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and the signiﬁ- cance remained after controlling for age, physical activ- ity and energy intake. overall, neither smoking status nor smoking intensity was positively associated with the levels of tc or ldl-c. these serum lipid parameters seem to be little inﬂuenced by smoking.32 however, other authors found a clear association of cigarette smoking with low levels of tc and ldl-c.33 in the present study, lower levels of hdl-c were associated with smoking status in men after table 3 baseline characteristics of daily smokers, according to the smoking intensity smoking intensity light smokers (n=135) moderate smokers (n=106) heavy smokers (n=13) p value body weight, kg(b,c) 71.3±13.6 70.8±12.8 81.3±18.0 0.009 bmi, kg/m2(b,c) 24.2±3.5 24.1±3.5 27.5±3.4 0.023 wc, cm 86.0±11.4 86.9±10.2 94.3±11.7 0.059 hc, cm 96.5±8.6 97.7±8.0 102.6±8.5 0.163 whr 0.890±0.08 0.890±0.07 0.920±0.07 0.280 whtr 0.502±0.06 0.508±0.06 0.545±0.05 0.266 fg, mmol(b,c) 4.3±0.6 4.4±0.8 5.3±2.6 0.010 tc, mmol 5.4±1.1 5.4±1.0 5.6±0.7 0.399 hdl-c, mmol 1.6±0.4 1.5±0.4 1.1±0.3 0.057 ldl-c, mmol 3.3±1.1 3.3±0.9 3.6±0.6 0.515 tc to hdl-c ratio(b,c) 3.6±1.2 3.9±1.2 5.5±1.8 0.033 tag, mmol(b,c) 1.1±0.6 1.3±0.7 2.5±1.9 0.006 total wcc, g/l(a) 7.0±1.8 8.0±2.3 8.0±2.2 0.035 values are shown as mean±sd. p value determined by multivariate anova and adjusted for age, physical activity and energy intake;

controlling for several confounders. also, the number of cigarettes smoked as well as pack years (data not shown) was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with hdl-c. with respect to the levels of fg, no differences were observed between smokers, non-smokers and former smokers. however, heavy smokers (>20 cigarettes per day) showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of fg compared with light and moderate smokers. the signiﬁcance per- sisted after controlling for age, physical activity and energy intake. the absolute mean values of fasting glucose increased in a graded manner according to the smoking intensity. these ﬁndings are of relevance because in a large number of prospective studies cigar- ette smoking has been associated with a higher risk of t2dm,34 especially in heavy smokers.35 the crude and adjusted mean values of total and dif- ferential wccs were signiﬁcantly higher in male and female smokers, compared with their non-smoking and former smoking counterparts. no differences were observed between non-smokers and former smokers, indicating a decrease in the wcc after smoking cessa- tion, close to the levels found in never-smokers. signs of inﬂammation in smokers are maybe not surprising con- sidering the strong inﬂammatory impact on the airways. however, systemic inﬂammatory diseases are also asso- ciated with smoking.36 when smokers were categorised according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day, statistically signiﬁ- cant differences in the total wccs were found between light and moderate smokers, after controlling for table 4 results of the multiple linear regressions (also controlled for age and education, not shown) coefficient body weight, kg bmi, kg/m2 wc, cm total wcc, g/l fasting glucose, mmol hdl-c, mmol tag, mmol females −5.3 −0.7 −4.3 0.5 −0.18 0.35 −0.32 body height, cm 0.8 na 0.3 na na na na occasional smokers −0.3 −0.2 −0.9 0.1 −0.03 −0.05 0.05 light smokers 0.2 −0.1 −0.2 0.6 −0.09 −0.12 0.11 moderate smokers −1.3 −0.2 −0.9 1.3 −0.04 −0.13 0.13 heavy smokers 9.5 3.5 7.1 1.7 0.74 −0.55 0.85 moderate physical activity −1.0 −0.5 −0.5 −0.8 – 0.04 −0.09 high physical activity −3.4 −1.2 −2.8 −0.8 – 0.12 −0.14 calories, kj/day 10.5 3.4 8.4 1.7 0.4 −0.2 0.1 occasional smokers, less than 1 cigarette per day; light smokers, 1–10 cigarettes per day; moderate smokers, 11–20 cigarettes per day; heavy smokers: >20 cigarettes per day. all smoking categories compared to non-smokers. bold coefficients: p<0.01; italic coefficients: p<0.05. na, not applicable (body height in the case of bmi and lab parameters); –, dropped from the model. bmi, body mass index; hdl-c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; tag, triacylglycerides; wc, waist circumference; wcc, white cell count. figure 1 (a) non-linear influence of cigarettes smoked per day on body weight, results of general additive model, spline function with 4 degrees of freedom.

confounders. although no signiﬁcant differences were found between light and heavy smokers, it is important to observe that the absolute differences between the means of the wccs in light and moderate smokers were the same as that between light and heavy smokers. the latter has not achieved statistical signiﬁcance probably due to the small number of heavy smokers in the sample, in comparison to light and moderate smokers. cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for ath- erosclerosis and cvd, as discussed before, and it has been recognised as the single most important factor known to inﬂuence the wcc.37 the wcc has been cor- related with cvd and is considered a biomarker of inﬂammatory processes that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression.38 this study has strengths and limitations. the strengths are the large sample size with a wide age range (19– 65 years) and the use of validated questionnaires for the assessment of smoking status and lifestyle—including diet, education level and physical activity. therefore, adjust- ment for important confounders could be performed. the limitations were the cross-sectional design of the study—which does not allow one to infer about cause and effect—and the use of self-reported weight and height as a routine in annual health check-ups, which were controlled by measurement only if deviant from earlier data, however, which could introduce bias to the study. studies have demonstrated the validity and reli- ability of self-reported height and weight in different study populations.39 moreover, self-reported bmi and measured wc were highly correlated in the present study, which suggests good quality of the present data. acknowledgements the authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the helpful co-operation of the employees under study and the support from the occupational health department of their institution. the thesis work was guided and supported by dr ibrahim elmadfa, director and professor, institute of nutritional sciences, university of vienna. contributors ldofg collected and sorted the data as part of her thesis work. the thesis paper formed the key basis of this paper. at helped her with the statistical analysis. mn advised her with the original study concept and later helped her to formulate the paper. this was partly a task of rewording and of shortening the original thesis. thesis papers tend to be rather long and turning this into a paper fit for a journal is a rather tough job. hm did additional statistical analyses (regression analyses, gam) and also helped with the wording and the submission work. funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector. competing interests none. ethics approval ethical commission of the city of vienna. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement the raw data (excel file) and additional analyses results are available on email request (hanns.moshammer@meduniwien.ac.at). open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the creative commons attribution non commercial (cc by-nc 3.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non- commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ references 1. statistik austria. österreichische gesundheitsbefragung 2006/2007: bundesanstalt statistik österreich 2007. wien, austria. http://www. statistik.at/web_de/dynamic/statistiken/gesundheit/publdetail?
