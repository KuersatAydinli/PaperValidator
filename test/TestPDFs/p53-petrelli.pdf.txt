  • when in a person’s life are mementos drawn from? do  they relate to the distant past, or throughout the lifespan?  • where are mementos kept, and does location relate to  their type? for example, are personal mementos kept in  private spaces and social mementos in public locations?  • invocation: how do people interact with mementos? are  they used as talking points with others, or are they placed  in personal spaces to facilitate more private reflection?  the study involves parents of young children touring their  house and discussing objects related to their own past. we  identify key principles that underlie objects becoming  mementos. we discuss the implications of our findings,  concluding with new design principles and concepts for  digital memory technologies.   related work  our research intersects autobiographical memories,  personal and family interaction, material culture and  technology. so far, prior research has focused on each of  the above separately and from a specific point of view.   research on memory has been carried out mainly in  psychology. recent work challenges the traditional view of  memory as a knowledge base [6], instead proposing a core  role for recollection and social dynamics [4, 10, 21, 27].  sociological studies of personal and family interaction have  focused on the role of objects [8] or photographs [5]. when  technology is included the focus is on family  communication [9, 16] or photo sharing [7, 12].   philosophers have theorized about the relation between the  self and the home as lived experience of the space [2] and  on the act of remembering as a constant shifting between  the abstract mind and the physical world [3].  some anthropological studies have examined material  culture and the life of individuals. the process of  commoditization changes the perceived value of objects  depending on the culture [20]. everyday objects can  become biographical [15] or evocative [25] by virtue of the  meaning imputed to them by the owner, e.g. as significant  personal possession [15], or symbols of experiences [25].  hci research has addressed helping people remember  factual information (e.g. [17, 18, 23]), with rather fewer  studies of the role of memories in people’s emotional life  and the implications for technology design. the memory  box [11] used a jewelry box metaphor to associate a  recorded narrative with a souvenir. it appealed more to  women and children: children used it as a personal journal,  while adults perceived the value of attaching narratives to  objects only if they were given/received as gifts – but not  for personal use. the work identified a clear need for a self- contained, simple technology for recording and playback.  the living memory box [13] supported the collection,  archiving and annotation of family memories. an  ethnographic study investigated the “who, what, where,  when and why of [parents] saving memories of their child’s  life”. parents collected some mementos for children but  never recorded stories related to those objects. the resulting  system allowed users to place a physical object in the  living memory box, record its appearance, an audio  narrative and metadata to support later retrieval. the  concept was tested with scrap-bookers. the results show  that personal archival systems must be designed differently  from pcs, supporting natural interaction (e.g. touch, voice).  souvenirs, personal memory, and recollection were  investigated in [26]. participants discussed souvenirs they  had brought to a focus group meeting. analysis of  discussions suggested that souvenirs are esoteric: they carry  meaning for their owner but this is obscure to others.  furthermore, the telling of the story behind the object  changed depending on the relation between owner and  audience. a questionnaire on the perceived value of  souvenirs and their function in people’s lives revealed:  souvenirs relate to memories of a personal experience  (holiday, honeymoon) or a specific person (heirloom, gift),  and are “used” (watched, talked about). informed by these  studies the author designed a system that used rfid-tagged  physical objects to retrieve a set of images previously  associated with the object. a hand-held device (a tablet pc)  allowed users to view images, share a subset on a tv,  manage collections, or send selected ones via email or print.  methodology  our fieldwork study aimed to understand the principles of  how and why an object becomes a memento. the home was  chosen as the place to study, as it is a space created and  cultivated as a “container” of the owners’ intimate self,  beliefs and aspirations. the family home in particular  contains personal and shared objects, the most valued often  being related to memories [8]. the family home is a richer  place to study than other inhabited public spaces, e.g. work  places, as participants have more control over how that  space is constituted and configured. we focused on families  with young children as being active collectors of mementos.  parents have memories of their own lives before meeting  their spouse; shared memories as a couple; and are  generally highly active as curators of their children’s  ‘future’ memories.   we recruited a middle class sample on the basis of [8]’s  finding that they are oriented to memories and relationships  in contrast to other social groups that focus more on  possessions. participants were recruited by acquaintance  and covered a range of professions (doctor, museum  conservationist, high-level managers, architect, training  consultant, publisher, marketing manager), a housewife  (with a degree in psychology) and a few academics.   in contrast to much previous research that used interviews  or focus groups for data collection, our participants had a  highly active role. we gave them this orienting information:  ‘we would like you to take us on a tour of your house. we  want to see rooms that you consider public, family rooms,  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 54


  and your own. in each room we would like you to pick 3  objects related to your life and tell us why each object is  special, when and how you got it, why it is in this room and  if you ever reflect on it or talk about it.’  for each participant, we collected at least 9 objects and  their associated explanations and stories. by contrasting  three different room types we wanted to probe the relations  between the public/private nature of the space and the type  and intimacy of the mementos in that space, e.g. a public  room used for entertaining, might display an artwork  received as gift, while the study might hold personally  significant pieces, e.g. photographs of holidays.  this “memory tour” allowed us to collect both  autobiographical narratives as well as observations about  object location and any accompanying emotions displayed  by the informant, e.g. the way an object was caressed or  held. while there were specific topics we intended  participants to discuss, e.g. what memory the object evoked  and why it was important, we let participants talk freely and  prompted only those topics that were not spontaneously  mentioned. the overall tone was informal and friendly, and  a small gift was given as token of gratitude for  participation. questions about the participant’s attitude  towards keeping objects concluded this memento tour. as  we shall see, only one participant made reference to digital  mementos during the tour, so we later explicitly probed  attitudes to digital mementos. participants were also asked  to draw/sketch their autobiography. for reasons of space,  we constrain our main analysis to the initial house tour and  the objects people selected in it.   data collection and analysis  in total, 16 people (from 12 families) participated in the  study, 6 men and 10 women; 5 were living in a country  different from the one they were born in. when both adult  family members participated, the tour was done  individually. each session lasted 90-120 mins. and was tape  recorded. pictures captured the memento and its context. in  total, 159 objects and their related stories were collected.  we were concerned that the affordance of the rooms and  the request to select 3 objects might bias interviewees.  however, participants often discussed more than the nine  stipulated objects if more important ones came to mind at a  later stage. moreover some participants in the first room of  the tour foreshadowed important mementos they would  discuss in later rooms, showing they have a clear idea of  which memories and mementos are important. follow-up  questions and comments also supported the view that we  were able to collect stories about people’s most critical  autobiographical memories.  we transcribed all the interview tours, and systematically  classified relevant portions of text. the topics of interest  were used to start a broad classification, e.g. type of object,  location, value, time (in the person’s life), while other  dimensions and refinements emerged from analysis of the  narratives, e.g. reference to specific periods in the owner’s  life or emotional involvement. we first generated a wide set  of terms that were later aggregated and distilled into a  smaller set. the final set of dimensions of analysis were:  • type of object.  • where the object was located, and how it was displayed.  • when in the owner’s life the object referred to.  • why the object was precious, and the nature of the  memory it represented.  • how it served as a memento, and   • in what way did it trigger memories?  the next section reports the results following this structure.   some participants claimed not to distinguish between  public and family rooms, while others clearly did, e.g. “we  use this room for proper visitors because friends would go  in the kitchen and the dining room, whereas people like the  financial advisor comes here”. by observing the properties  of rooms classified by most participants as public, family  and personal, we were able to extend the classification to all  participants: public - formal rooms (sitting room, lounge),  family - informal places (family room, kitchen, dining- room) and personal - rooms like bedroom or study.  findings  types of mementos  one striking observation was that only one participant  chose a digital object during the tour: “maps. i make my  own maps because i do a lot of cycling and journeys. these  maps then become the memory of the occasion and it’s  quite vivid for me”. this was not because the other 15  people did not have any digital mementos: indeed when we  later specifically asked them to describe their digital  artifacts, they referred to videos, digital pictures, emails and  recordings. it was also clear these digital objects  engendered strong feelings: “[video] is a wonderful way of  seeing someone alive, and when you’re far away i think it  has even more significance”, “lots of emails, the history of  what we were doing […] feels like a record i would like to  keep”. nevertheless, despite this rich potential and their  visibility in the toured rooms in the form of tapes or dvds,  only one digital memento was spontaneously chosen and  talked about.   much prior sociological and technology work on memory  has studied photographs and how these are used for  personal reflection and sharing [7, 12]. consistent with  those studies, we found some instances of photographs as  significant mementos, especially if these were old, unique  or irreplaceable in nature: “this is my father, who died quite  young, it’s one of the few photographs i’ve got of him.”   however photos were only one of a much larger set of  objects that served as mementos. strikingly, photos  accounted for only 16% of mementos, and six people did  not refer to photos at all. this does not mean that their  houses did not have any photographs on display, but rather  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 55


  that participants consciously selected other type of objects  as the mementos they most relate to.   artwork was another frequent choice, accounting for 28%  of mementos discussed. it could take the form of  professionally produced paintings or photographs, prints or  drawings (17% mementos). an example is given by a  scientist originally from france, who describes two paired  paintings on display in the front room (a. is her husband,  k. a close friend): “i never thought that i would ever buy  artworks, but meeting k. opened my eyes, and this is done  by a french artist. a. picked it, and he knew i would love it,  he just borrowed it from k.’s gallery and brought it home  and said ‘what do you think of that?’ he was able to pick  something that i totally loved … it is amazing that you  could understand someone like that, and for me, it gives me  peace, it’s a kind of giant monk, framed, and i’m never  tired of looking at it, and it’s the sort of first step in  discovering that art is accessible to everyone, really”  the quote shows that the function of the painting goes well  beyond the simple aesthetic. instead it is an embodiment of  the strong bond with a, who has an ‘amazing  understanding’ of her, and k who pushed her, a scientist, to  discover her artistic side. less evident, but significant, is  the connection to her roots - as the artist, like her, is french.   another important class of artwork was amateur efforts  produced by family or friends (accounting for 11%  mementos), in particular young children’s art and craftwork  projects (9%). one such example was a framed print  produced by the son (f) and described by the father in this  way (j is his wife) (fig. 2):    figure 2 “it is a print that f did... he did it very quickly at a  fair... i do printing... i’m kind of interested... this is art and  is really fantastic... it is also funny because when he did it  he said very clearly it was uncle r... a crazy beast or a  monkey is actually j’s brother...we like it because he made,  is very beautiful and funny but it is also a secret.”  this object is important not only because it was made by  his son, but also for the special bond between father and son  via the printing activity, and the shared secret depiction of  another family member.  as both examples show, these artworks were valued not  only for aesthetic but for other reasons, i.e. bonds with  family and friends, symbols of significant aspects of their  lives, and humor.  somewhat to our surprise, mass-produced objects often  served as important mementos, and account for 28%.  mundane everyday objects such as a cup, clock, coffee  machine, golf tee, pots, cookery book, teapot, children toys,  ladder, calendar, bed, stove, candle holder and books were  all chosen and talked about. what make them special is the  time and energy invested in using them, as from the  following examples.    figure 3: “object number one is this mug … which is  actually broken … i’ve kept it because i really really like it  … i will never use it again but i can’t quite bear to throw it  away i feel very emotionally attached to it for some reason.  […] i bought it in london, when i was working in london.  it cost a lot of money … it felt like an indulgence but i felt  like i could. i think [it’s the memory of] working in  publishing, living in london and going through a sort of  fulfilling patch in my career ... also i associate it with  buying my first house, having it there in the kitchen in my  first house…so its also an object of continuity because i  think i must have had it for … ooh … let me think i’ve  probably had it for nearly 20 years!”  in some cases, the value of a mundane object goes beyond  its use, like in the following example where another french  woman talks about a french cookery book: “this cookery  book is by joanne harris who wrote ‘chocolat’ i often use  it when cooking with my girls on special occasions like  christmas day. … she’s british, but she’s got a french  mother […] when i first read ‘chocolat’ i was thinking:  ‘this has to be the island [where i spent all my holidays as  a child], it has to be’. and then i found this cookery book,  and there’s plenty of photos of the island!”  the book symbolizes intimacies with her daughters but is  also a connection to her native country and her roots via the  island where she spent childhood summer holidays and  where she still has a family home.  everyday objects become mementos by virtue of what the  owner has invested in them, be it time or emotion. thus, it  is not usually the physical characteristic of the objects that  make them biographical, but the meaning imputed to them  as significant personal possessions. this makes everyday  objects substantially different from iconic and  representational objects like photos and artworks. everyday  objects gain value by progressive appropriation: it does not  matter if they become worn or cracked as this reflects the  time passed for them and the owner alike.  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 56


  yet other participants chose what seemed to be unintuitive  objects which we called memorabilia - accounting for 20%  of mementos. these were objects with a specific function,  but unlike the everyday objects they were not in habitual  use. examples here included a stereoscope, rocking horse,  measuring glasses, and a set of illustrated cards.   a final class of mementos, accounting for 8% of the  objects, was highly idiosyncratic – falling outside the above  categories. they included a shell collection; pregnancy cast;  a jar containing a father’s ashes; child’s first nose bogey;  hand made lead bullet; a framed 1997 coffee shop receipt;  30 years of diaries; “objets trouvé” (e.g. a dog collar tag  without a dog - “maybe one day i’ll phone this number, and  find out a bit more about barney the dog or his owner”).   idiosyncratic objects are important for deeply personal  reasons. the medieval scholar who selected his baby son’s  first bogies provides this motivation: “[laughing] some  people keep their child’s hair, why not a bogey?[then  seriously] in the middle age they believed that this things  were important… bits of body were used for invoking  magical powers… keeping his bogies was in line with that  tradition”. apart the humorous intention, the connection  between early memories of his son and his professional  interest is evident.   idiosyncratic mementos are often intentionally created: “the  cast of my tummy when i was five months with r, i got the  idea from some beautiful casts made in my friend’s art  gallery. my pregnancy with r was the last one and i wanted  to have some memento of it, and it was quite fun to do it.”  other idiosyncratic objects become mementos by chance  because of what they symbolized: “a receipt, from a café, in  buenos aires for two ‘submarinos’, a kind of argentinean  version of hot chocolate. you cannot really see because it’s  faded but the date was christmas day, christmas day  1997. there’s a story about that. years ago, every saturday  guardian1 had a competition […] we won a pair of air  france tickets to go anywhere they flew! so we went to  buenos aires for christmas and spent new year in paris.  so it’s a sort of celebratory thing, it reminds us of our lucky  win but what we didn’t know at that time is that j was  pregnant, so we probably wouldn’t have gone if we knew. i  guess that’s a memory of the trip and the gift of our family.”  the receipt was later rediscovered in a guidebook and  framed.  in sum, we found a large variety of different objects served  as mementos, although only one was digital in format.  photos, often considered as the prototypical memory  trigger, were only the fourth most frequent type of object.  as expected, artwork was popular, but to our surprise we  found an equal number of everyday objects being invested  with mnemonic significance, as well as much more unusual  memorabilia and idiosyncratic objects. what makes those                                                              1 the guardian is a popular british newspaper.  other objects substantially different from photographs and  artworks is that the relation to the original memory is often  highly indirect. they do not directly represent significant  events or people, nor are they conventionally visually  attractive. as will become more evident later, their  selection seems to be motivated by the fact that the owner  has invested emotions in them, building meanings, and  spending time cultivating them.  where in the house were mementos located?  the reason for asking participants to select objects from  public, family and personal rooms was to explore the  relation between object type and location, e.g. were photos  more likely to be in family/private than public spaces? do  people put objects that connote different meanings in  different locations, e.g. social relationships in public?   table 1. types of objects and their locations (p is  professional, a is amateur).    differences were found among rooms (table 1). public  locations often display professional artwork, primarily  because of their aesthetic quality. in contrast, family spaces  contain more amateur artwork (e.g. by children) to reinforce  relationships in areas where families spend more time.  although memorabilia are generally kept to personal zones,  they can at times be on display in public rooms as objects of  curiosity or conversation, like granny’s fruit plate or the  framed receipt described above.        figure 4. photos, artwork and memorabilia in public spaces.  finally personal spaces tended to have more objects related  to the self (40%) or to long past events (20%). here we also  saw more symbols of professional achievement or personal  interest, as well as more memorabilia and idiosyncratic  objects. the reason for this dichotomy (memorabilia and  idiosyncratic objects in personal spaces vs. artwork and  photos in shared spaces), is clear in the words of an  informant describing her grandmother’s perpetual calendar  that she keeps in her study (fig. 5):    artworks photo everyday memorabilia idiosyncratic  public 44% (p=39, a=5) 17% 25% 11% 3%  family 38% (p=16, a=22) 18% 33% 9% 2%  personal 15% (p=10, a= 5) 15% 27% 29% 14%  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 57


    figure 5: “that’s something i remember  playing with a lot as a child [..]  sometimes these things are … erm…  untranslatable or “uncommunicable”. i  mean, [my husband] would say: “oh,  why do you keep that?” ”  in addition we looked at where in the room the objects were  positioned. our expectation was that objects would occupy  prominent spots to serve as constant reminders of people’s  pasts, or to spark conversation with friends and relatives.  this was true for artworks, photos, everyday objects and  some memorabilia in public spaces. “i like to have [the  pots] out … people would say “oh that’s a nice pot.” and i  say “my dad made it, actually.” so there is a sort of  conversation point, too.”  strikingly, 25% of selected objects were not on display but  put away in cupboards and drawers. in some cases the  fragile nature of the object (china, glass) is the reason for  storing. often however (47% of time) the concealed objects  were related to the person’s distant past and rediscovering  them is a special event, as discussed below.  in summary, there is a clear autotopography of rooms.  there are clear differences in the type of mementos people  use to populate their social, family and personal spaces and  in the position they choose for those objects. photos are  distributed throughout the house, professional artworks are  more likely to be found in public rooms while amateur  (mainly children’s) artwork is in the family room.  memorabilia and idiosyncratic objects are generally  restricted to personal spaces. these differences seem to  reflect different levels of intimacy with the spaces,  providing good evidence for autotopographies.   what time period do mementos refer to?  we also looked at when in the person’s life the mementos  referred to. previous research has described mementos that  are typically objects from the distant past [6]. we did find  some instances of objects invoking distant childhood (19%,  of which 12% were early years, 7% teen-age) and youth  (9%). however, the highest percentage (46%) of mementos  relate to the recent past (the last 10 years) - connecting to  current relationships and family. another 22% of mementos  refer to adulthood before marriage, as in the example of the  whale mug. finally 4% related to the interviewee’s roots.   the time in the person’s life that the memory refers to  affects the memento’s location (table 2). table 2. time of memory by location.    while mementos from the recent past are equally  distributed in the different locations, childhood mementos  are rarely found in public spaces. those in personal areas  are more likely to be related to the distant past than in other  areas of the house (41% refer to youth or childhood). the  high overall percentage of mementos from the recent past  may represent ‘memory in progress’ - objects for which the  owner is currently building the meaning as time passes. the  example of the shells above is one such case, or as revealed  in “[the children’s books] for me it’s sort of transmitting  the love of reading”.   why did people choose these objects?  the next questions we addressed were how and why these  objects served as mementos.   previous research has documented three main functions for  mementos: referring to events, relationships, and the self  [8]. our findings confirm, but expand, those results. as we  expected, 13% mementos represented an important event  such as a wedding or birth, a significant period in a person’s  life, such as attending university, or long-term hobbies like  bicycling.    events relationship reminiscing  total 13% 59% 28%  public 4% 16% 2%  family 2% 20% 7%  personal 7% 23% 19%  table 3. motivations for mementos with respect to places.  59% of objects signified a relationship with others. as  expected, some of these objects were direct depictions of  others (e.g. photos) or gifts received from others. however  relationships often went beyond these simple links, e.g.  they might represent activities done together, e.g. sculptures  done in an art class taken by both partners, children’s  artwork from weekly visits to the library for children’s  story time, or the french cookery book discussed above.  a more individual function is personal reminiscence –  where a person privately interacts with the memento to  relive previous life experiences. 28% of objects were of this  type. however personal reminiscence turned out to have  multiple aspects. it could refer to identity – memories that  contribute to the person being who they are - such as photos  of ancestors, or childhood memorabilia. but it might also  relate to the self in more complicated ways, such as objects  that reflect interests, e.g. tools used for a favorite hobby.  alternatively they could refer to achievements the person  was particularly proud of, such as awards, authored books,  or a medal for completing the london marathon.  object function also relates to its location, with social  rooms (public and family) dominated by relationships, and  personal spaces having more reminiscing (table 3).  the position of the object in the room also depends on its  function (table 4). as expected, mementos of relationships   roots childhood youth adulthood recent past  total 4% 19% 9% 22% 46%  public 1% 3% 1% 4% 13%  family 2% 3% 2% 5% 17%  personal 1% 13% 6% 13% 16%  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 58


  are prominent or on display; mementos of reminiscing are  prominent if they are self-referential, or concealed if they  are nostalgic objects.  in contrast to previous research, in 30% of cases we  discovered multiple motivations for choosing an object.  e.g. personal, social and life events are all mentioned in the  following excerpt where l reveals how a shell collection  (fig. 1) relates to family holidays (events), her childhood  (personal), and her children’s education (social): “the shells  are quite important because they are memories of our  holidays, and we each year build up our collection. i had a  collection of shells when i was a child displayed in boxes  labelled with their names. … this is the past six years and  each time we add more. [collecting shells] helps to  entertain the kids for a long time on the beach, and [gives a  purpose]. i find that if you do an activity and then you don’t  do anything to it, it’s a bit negative, it’s like you’re wasting  you’re time.”  table 4. position of mementos with respect to motivations.  the reasons why an object is valued include family bonds  (44%), nostalgia (20%), aesthetic (16%), and moral values  (15%). the importance of mementos as conveyers of moral  values was unexpected but evident, sometimes made  explicit as in the excerpt above, but other times more  implicit: “my grandmother was sort of very liberal quite a  modern sort of person. she was very accepting and  welcoming” (when discussing her grandmother’s china).  many participants exhibited quite strong feelings “it’s  amazing that you could understand someone like that”, or  in the way they held and caressed objects. as expected,  happy memories were more frequent: 30% were described  as ‘very happy’ and 42% ‘happy’. but somewhat curiously,  20% of mementos did not seem to stimulate particular  emotions.  contrary to other work on photos [5], 80% of participants  mentioned at least one object related to sad events, such as  death or divorce. but often people talked about sad  memories in a positive way, e.g. remembering positive  aspects of the personality of a dead parent, or talking about  the difficult times as “having moved on” and “realizing how  happy i am now”.   personal spaces tended to contain more instances of objects  that invoked very happy or very sad memories: 59% of very  happy memories are in personal spaces, compared with  25% in family and 16% in public ones. sad mementos are  never on display in public rooms, but are located in  personal (67%) or family (33%) spaces.    summarizing, there are often multiple reasons why objects  are selected. mementos that represent relationships can be  found in any room while objects related to personal  reminiscing are generally confined to personal spaces.  moreover objects symbolizing relationships are mostly on  display and in prominent positions. objects for reminiscing  occupy personal spaces, but are often concealed and  reserved for special occasions.  how are mementos invoked?  our initial expectation was that mementos would be  prominent and visible, to support functions of personal- reminiscence and sharing. we discovered sharing  memories goes beyond the simple showing of photos of  events or relations to family and friends documented in  prior work [10, 5]. such sharing can cement parent-child  relationships as when a mother explored her childhood  memory box with her daughter k. (fig. 6):    figure 6: “this was given to me by my grandmother when i  was ten, and this was given to me by my mother when i was  six, and this is my brownie badge… i showed [the box] to  k. the other day and she was absolutely over the moon, she  said ‘i want a locket as well, with pictures of my mum and  dad in it!’ […] you know, they’ve all got enormous  meaning to me, but only to me now. […] the only people i  would think about sharing, would be the children. there is  nothing inherently important. it’s only important because it  makes a link across the generations.”  spending time with children to explain one’s own story, or  those of parents, grandparents or extended family was a  recurring theme. parents and children alike enjoy it.  boxes and containers of memorabilia as in the example are  not unusual: thirteen (80%) of our participants showed or  mentioned at least one such collection. generally  collections contain mementos of distant periods of the  person’s life, e.g. childhood, university life, and are created  opportunistically with what has survived years of sorting  and clearing. other times they are created for a purpose,  e.g. wedding memorabilia chest, or a family treasures box:  “my mother picked up all sorts of lovely little family  treasures: pictures of my great grandparents, my great  grandmother’s sewing things, my great uncles wooden  carvings and all sorts of old family things. it’s like a little  corner of part of my life.”  these boxes of memories are often not easily accessible  (stored in an attic, or deep in a wardrobe) and rarely  opened. however when rediscovered they act as ‘time         events relationship reminiscing  prominent 45% 6% 27% 11%  display 31% 6% 22% 3%  concealed 24% 3% 10% 11%  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 59


  capsules’, a whole past world is opened and the owner is  thrown back in time - deeply immersed in reminiscing:  “that’s one of [my son’s] first pairs of socks can you  remember when they were this tiny look look look … oh i  haven’t looked in here for years funnily enough … little  bootie … oh i can’t even remember those were his first pair  of little booties.” having these objects in constant view  would habituate people; so concealing them makes more  salient the contrast between that past world and the current  one, triggering a world of nostalgia when brought to light.   at the opposite end of the spectrum are mundane objects  that are often directly integrated into everyday activity:  “that was my father’s step ladder, you see, and actually we  have many objects of my father’s around this house, even  his car keys, the kids use his car keys as part of their toys …  i really like that because they’re quite disappointed that  they never knew him.”   incorporating memories into everyday life was a recurring  topic: two people passed their teddy bears to their children,  a girl played with her mother’s jewelry, a son with his  father’s bow, an old stove found a new place in the lounge,  and a grandmother’s teapot was used everyday. people  seemed to derive comfort from the integration of past and  future, knowing that an important aspect of their past was  somehow evoked every time they made a cup of tea, or lit  the stove. embedding mementos into a familiar space  changes their nature: “these photos are in the grain of the  room, they’re not just there because they can be. sticking [a  photo] on [the wall] is consuming it … i often point one out  to people ... that is so and so”. from this perspective, using  mementos is more important than preserving them: “objects  on display are to be used, and not to be a museum piece.  from time to time something does get broken … the other  day when i was mowing the lawn i mashed up my father’s  car keys because the kids had left them out there […] i’d  rather mash them up, knowing that the kids enjoyed playing  with them for a few years rather than just have them in a  cupboard.”  participants often mentioned the periodic sorting and  clearing of personal belongings, distilling out what is still  worth keeping: “that drawer is all that survived from that  bit of my childhood, really. it’s been weeded down year  after year. and every time you go through the drawer ‘oh  god! look at all this rubbish, it’s gotta go.’ i wouldn’t want  to get rid of them altogether. i very much like having them  here, in my house now”. distillation is crucial: the process  of going through a small collection of memorabilia is  emotionally powerful, but large boxes put people off:  “loads of cardboard boxes with loads of stuff, in general  junk really. i should chuck all out but i feel i should go  through it and decide what i want to keep and it will take  ages so i never do … so the boxes sit in there”. as a result  the content of these large boxes has little value, as it is  never accessed. thus having a compact collection is  important in sustaining interaction throughout a lifetime.   in sum, different mementos are located in different places,  affording different types of invocation. apart from being  displayed, memories are integrated in everyday life through  mundane objects in everyday use - signaling continuity  between past and present. of particular emotional  significance are small collections of objects concealed and  opened only rarely. accessing important collections,  revisiting and sorting them is an enjoyable activity,  reserved for smaller collections, while bigger ones tend to  be ignored as the effort needed is perceived as too great.  other observations  there were other recurrent observations that fell outside the  above analytic scheme.   distinct gender differences emerged. for example, women  seemed to determine what objects were placed in public  spaces. as a result, men did not always find it possible to  select 3 of their own objects in public or family spaces, and  often resorted to talking about their wife’s objects - making  only weak connections with them. in contrast, they were  much more forthcoming in their own space, such as their  study, talking about more than 3 objects in this setting.   consistent with other work [8], there were also large  differences between men and women in terms of the objects  that they chose. men tended to choose objects that  referenced themselves and promoted personal reminiscence,  e.g. things that signified their interests or achievements. in  contrast, women’s objects tend to highlight relationships  with family and friends.  the role of parents (and grandparents) as curators of  children’s memory was also evident. every family saved  children’s artworks. keeping, however, is not only done for  the children, but for the parents to remind themselves of  their offspring’s achievements. grandparents have an active  role in connecting generations: most memorabilia boxes  had been recently passed on from the grandparents to  parents to be shared with the children.   designing digital mementos  we now discuss the design implications of our findings. in  particular we are interested in bridging the divide between  physical and digital memories. as we noted, only one  participant selected a digital object as a memento, despite  the fact that we later established that all our participants had  large collections of digital memorabilia. can we integrate  these currently different worlds, combining some of the  mnemonic affordances of physical objects into currently  underexploited digital resources, or designing physical  objects with enhanced digital mnemonic properties?  active selection not capture  few participants viewed their activities as ‘capture’ in the  way that current technology projects describe lifelogging.  capturing a large collection of mementos and later  accessing these when needed is done only with photos.  instead participants talked about sifting through and  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 60


   revisiting small collections of objects, choosing highly  specific items for the associations that they triggered. the  size of the collection matters and large collections tended to  be ignored. this may be the fate of lifelog data, stored  somewhere and ignored, if the owner is not given tools for  sorting, clearing and distilling what is of value. it may  therefore be that the processes involved in the creation of  highly meaningful memory objects are very different from  the rhetoric of total capture of one’s entire life. meaning  construction rather than easy search should therefore be the  goal of memory technology and time spent managing  digital mementos should be perceived as creative and  enjoyable, a substantially different experience from  standard pc use. in practical terms, we need to build tools  that facilitate sifting and selecting, rather than tools to  retrieve any event from one’s past.   augmenting objects with digital memories  the types of mementos people value is varied. much  current work on digital memory technology has focused on  representational objects, especially photos. however  photos (and pictorial artwork) accounted for less than half  of the objects people chose. one obvious implication here is  that we need to extend the set of digital technologies  beyond the pictorial. while some work has begun to  develop technologies that allow users to interact with other  types of significant objects [13, 26], we need to broaden our  designs to encompass everyday objects, memorabilia and  other idiosyncratic objects that we saw being talked about  here. we need ubiquitous technologies that allow users to  interact with and manipulate external objects, rather than  focusing on the ‘capture’ of images of events or people.  the key principles designers should keep in mind are that  digital mementos have to be tangible as well as long lasting,  self-contained and straightforward to access.   non-pictorial technologies usually bear an indirect,  symbolic relationship to the original memory, and it is the  informant’s narrative that invests them with the relevant  mnemonic meaning. in contrast to a wedding or vacation  photo, one cannot look at nose bogey, a café bill or teapot  and infer why these might be highly significant to their  owner. but if we broaden the class of memory objects  beyond the pictorial, we need new technologies that allow  users to annotate and provide narrative explanations for the  objects they value. our participants showed great pleasure  in manipulating their mementos indicating the value of  embedding recording and playing functions in the object  itself [13, 26], rather than a specialized device designed for  memory capture.  a memento for every mood  mementos can be invoked in different ways. they can be  displayed in prominent places, to be seen, reflected upon  and shared via conversations; or they can be integrated into  everyday life through everyday objects. finally they can be  revealed – so that when they are uncovered they regenerate  forgotten experiences relating to concealed collections of  objects. however current work on digital mementos has  focused largely on the first types of usage, namely display  and sharing, as represented by the use of large displays  such as tabletops, tvs, or dedicated photoframes. rather  less attention has been paid to integration or concealment.  how might we support these types of invocation?  integration might be achieved through the use of  augmented reality techniques whereby everyday objects  such as cups, teapots or even stepladders may source  memories directly, e.g. placing a rfid tagged cup in a  given location triggers sounds or images from the memory  period relevant to that object. investigations of these  concepts has just begun: tagged souvenirs can retrieve  related photos for display on a tablet pc [26] and an  augmented shelf play narratives associated with the  mementos that are placed on it [11]. although some work  addresses revealing [13], this may be more complex to  support. how can we provide dedicated containers for small  classes of physical or digital objects that allow users to  ‘enter that past world’? a special digital container could  allow depositing digital (and physical) mementos by just  dropping them into it. it might be a box that could be  flattened when open providing a wider surface for  interaction; it should be self contained, portable and not  need additional software to show its content. as an  augmented object (e.g. via rfid) is deposited, additional  information can be automatically collected by the container  and stored locally. when, 20 years later, the owner opens  the container, she will find not only the objects she put in it  but additional information that was automatically added -  pictures of her friends at that time, her university timetable,  maps of her travels in peru, the music and news she was  listening to, and clips of her then favorite tv programs.  memories to fit living spaces  we discovered a clear relation between object types and  their locations. as expected, we found different classes of  objects, with different emotional character in public, family  and personal settings. again we might want to think about  different design characteristics for these different spaces, or  augmented environments, with the emphasis being on  display techniques in public areas, integration of everyday  objects in family areas, and revealing/reflection in personal  locations. an alternative is that a single object might have  different properties in each location. thus grandma’s teapot  might retrieve old family photographs when placed on the  family interactive table for social sharing with the cousin’s  family visiting; when taken upstairs to the bedroom and  placed next to grandma’s portrait the teapot will play the  stories she was used to tell the cousins at bedtime when  they were young girls spending their holidays in her house.  conclusions  we conducted a field study to understand the principles  underlying the relations between people, their memories  and their mementos. people relate to a small number of  objects that are carefully selected and invested with  meaning. personal reminiscing and sharing of pictorial  chi 2008 proceedings · stories and memories april 5-10, 2008 · florence, italy 61


  representations are not the only ways of relating to personal  memories. mementos are ubiquitous, but their nature and  functions can be very different. artworks in public spaces  support social display and conversation, children’s  drawings and mundane objects in the kitchen comfort the  family in everyday life, while long forgotten private  memorabilia kept in a drawer unlock emotions. mementos  in inhabited spaces thus create a memory landscape of  autobiographical objects, an autotopography. “an addition,  a trace, and a replacement for the intangible aspects of  desire, identification, and social relations” [12]. the design  of technology for personal memories must carefully  consider these findings to avoid creating devices that do not  reflect these processes. tangible digital mementos,  everyday objects augmented with digital memories and  ambient technology show more promise than the  lifelogging perspective. we need to move away from a  philosophy of exhaustive ‘capture’ towards technologies  that support active remembering with multiple types of  objects that can be appropriated in highly flexible ways.  acknowledgements  this research was partially supported by the eu memoir  grant: mtkd-ct-2005-030008. we are indebted to the  study participants, for sharing their stories and thoughts.   references  1. bell, g. and gemmell, j a (2007) digital life. scientific  american, march 2007.  2. bechelard, g.
