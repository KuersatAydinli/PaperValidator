and the terminal phase of cell division.5–7 in this context, the development and maintenance of the granulomatous inﬂammation in sarcoidosis have been repeatedly associated with the impaired apoptosis of acti- vated inﬂammatory cells.8 9 most of the early-stage sar- coidosis is characterised by mononuclear cell alveolitis dominated by activated cd4 t cells and macrophages. between these cells, the uncoordinated interplay results in the formation of typical non-caseating granulomas. the mechanism by which the granulomas resolve has not been fully elucidated. however, it is generally assumed that apoptosis and the withdrawal of inﬂamma- tory cytokines are involved in the disappearance of granulomas.10 11 in patients with sarcoidosis, their per- ipheral blood monocytes were characterised by apoptosis.9 in previous studies, case–control/family ‘hypothesis- driven’ studies and low density linkage scans were used to identify genetic factors conferring the genetic suscep- tibility to sarcoidosis.12 notably, the ﬁrst genome-wide association study (gwas) in sarcoidosis, conducted in a german population, has recently revealed an associ- ation: the leading rs2789679 snp (single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp)) located in the 30-utr (untrans- lated region) and a common non-synonymous snp (rs1049550, c>t, arg230cys) were associated with the increased risk of sarcoidosis.4 13 this association has recently been supported by another report from the same population.14 thus, more studies should be per- formed to demonstrate the following items: whether these snps modulate the risk of sarcoidosis by them- selves or whether they correlate with other causative snps and are repeated in other populations. the pub- lished studies about the association of sarcoidosis and anxa11 are summarised in online supplementary table s1. we hypothesise that common variants in the anxa11 gene may signiﬁcantly contribute to the predis- position to develop sarcoidosis. in this study, we investigated 15 loci in a chinese population from the he’nan province (china) to verify the putative association between anxa11 polymorph- isms and sarcoidosis. subjects and methods subjects four hundred and twelve patients with sarcoidosis (mean±sd age: 53.6±4.6 years; 155 men and 257 women) were recruited from our hospital between may 2005 and march 2013. sarcoidosis was diagnosed by the evidence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma in biopsy specimens and chest x-ray (cxr) abnormalities. chronic sarcoidosis was deﬁned as a disease over at least 2 years or at least two episodes in a lifetime. acute sar- coidosis was deﬁned as one episode of acute sarcoidosis which had totally resolved at the date of the examin- ation. the control group consisted of 418 unrelated healthy participants (mean±sd age: 54.2±5.3 years; 160 men and 258 women) who underwent health examina- tions in the medical examination center of the first afﬁliated hospital of the xinxiang medical college (xinxiang, china) between october 2009 and september 2013. none of the individuals in the control group had a history of lung diseases or showed any symptoms of the lung or other diseases by cxr or laboratory blood tests. participants were excluded if they: were taking other prescribed medications that could affect the central nervous system; had a history of seizures, hematological diseases or severe liver or kidney impairment; or were pregnant. no familial relationship was known between the study participants. snp selection tagging snps were selected from the catalogues of the international hapmap project. the rs2789679 and rs2245168 are located in 5’-utr, rs2236558 in intron 6, rs7067644 and rs12763624 in intron 8, rs1049550 in exon 10, rs2573351 in intron 13, rs10887581, rs11201989, rs2573353, rs2789695, rs2573356, rs2819945, rs11202059 and rs2819941 in intron 14 (see online sup- plementary ﬁgure s1). marker selection was based on the following criteria. (a) we used the chb data from the hapmap (release 27) to select tagsnps for anxa11. (b) we restricted our search for tagsnps from base pair 80155124 to base pair 80205677. (c) further, we limited snps to tag to those with a minor allele frequency ≥0.2 in the chb. (d) based on these restrictions, there were a total of 29 snps. (e) using haploview with an r2 threshold ≥0.8, 15 tagsnp were selected and used for subsequent analyses. genotyping peripheral blood was collected from a vein into a sterile tube coated with edta. plasma samples were stored at −20°c. genomic dna was extracted from the frozen peripheral blood samples using a qiamp blood mini kit (qiagen inc., valencia, california, usa) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. the selected snps were genotyped in cases and controls by using the maldi-tof in the massarray system (sequenom inc., san diego, california, usa). probes and primers were designed using the assay design software (sequenom, san diego, california, usa). the completed genotyping reactions were spotted onto a 384 well spectrochip (sequenom) using the massarray nanodispenser (sequenom) and determined by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. genotype calling was performed in real time with the massarray rt software v.3.0.0.4 and analysed using the massarray typer software v.3.4 (sequenom). statistical analysis all data were analysed using the spss v.17.0 software (spss inc., chicago, illinois, usa). the hardy- weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by χ2 tests. differences between cases and controls in the frequency 2 feng x, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004466. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004466 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


of the alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were evaluated by fisher’s exact test or the pearson χ2 test. unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the or and 95% ci in independent association between each locus and the presence of sarcoidosis. gender and age of participants were treated as covariants in binary logistic regression. p values were calculated based on codominant, dominant for the rare allele, heterosis and recessive for the rare allele models of inheritance. models of multiple logistic regression were used to test the independence of individual allelic effect. in detail, the most signiﬁcant snp was chosen to be the conditional snp (covariate in the regression model) when testing other signiﬁcant snps; meanwhile, a multi-snp model including all signiﬁcant snps was also performed. the bonferroni correction was used to adjust the test level when multiple comparisons were conducted, and the p value was divided by the total number of loci. haplotype blocks were deﬁned according to the criteria developed by gabriel et al15 pairwise ld statistics (d0 and r2) and haplotype frequency were calculated, and haplotype blocks were constructed using the haploview 4.0.16 to ensure that the ld blocks most closely reﬂect the popula- tion level ld patterns, the deﬁnition of blocks was based on the control samples alone. the haplotype frequencies were estimated using genecounting, which computes maximum-likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies from unknown phase data by utilising an expectation-maximisation algorithm.17–20 the signiﬁ- cance of any haplotypic association was evaluated using a likelihood ratio test, followed by permutation testing that compared estimated haplotype frequencies in cases and controls.17 19 results the genotype distribution of the 15 polymorphisms was consistent with the hardy-weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). the analysis of strong ld in patients with sar- coidosis and healthy controls revealed that 2 snps (rs2245168, rs2236558), 2 snps (rs1049550, rs2573351), 2 snps (rs2789695, rs2573356) and 3 snps (rs2819945, rs11202059, rs2819941) were located in haplotype block 1, block 2, block 3 and block 4 (d0>0.9, ﬁgure 1). the genotype distribution, allelic frequencies and haplo- types in patients with sarcoidosis and healthy controls are showed in tables 1–3 and online supplementary table s2. a comparison of genotype and allele frequency distribu- tion revealed signiﬁcant differences between patients with sarcoidosis and healthy controls for 3 snps: rs2789679, rs1049550 and rs2819941. the frequency of the rs1049550 t allele (p=0.000002, or=0.61, 95% ci 0.49 to 0.74) in figure 1 the ld plot of the 15 snps in the anxa11 gene. values in squares are the pairwise calculation of r2 (left) or d0 (right). black squares indicate r2=1 (ie, perfect ld between a pair of (single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps)). empty squares indicate d0=1 (ie, complete ld between a pair of snps). feng x, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004466. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004466 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


patients with sarcoidosis was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the controls. these differences remained statistically sig- niﬁcant after bonferroni corrections. the rs1049550 was the most signiﬁcant of the three. a multi-snp model revealed rs1049550 to be the only signiﬁcant independent snp association with sarcoidosis risk. the multi-snp model showed that only rs1049550 pre- sented a signiﬁcant effect on disease phenotype (p<0.001). no independent effect was found for rs2789679 or rs2819941 when adjusting for the effect of rs1049550. individual snp and multi-snp analysis sup- ported rs1049550: t allele was an important protective factor for affecting sarcoidosis (or around 0.6). in words, carriers of rs1049550: the c allele has higher sus- ceptibility to sarcoidosis in our chinese han population (see online supplementary table s3). we performed an association analysis to determine whether the haplotype was associated with the risk of sar- coidosis (global p<0.05 in block 2 and block 3). compared with controls, the t–c haplotype occurred signiﬁcantly less frequently (p=0.001) but c–c haplo- types occurred more frequently (p=0.0001) in block 2 (rs1049550–rs2573351) in patients with sarcoidosis. to assess particular disease phenotypes, patients with sarcoidosis were divided into subgroups according to their cxr stage. cxr stage i (isolated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy): n=196; cxr stages ii–iv (inﬁltra- tion of parenchyma): 167; cxr stage 0 (absence of pul- monary disease): n=28; the information on cxr stage was not available for 21 patients. genotype frequency distribution revealed that, in rs1049550, the cc geno- type was signiﬁcantly more in patients with cxr stage i sarcoidosis than in patients with cxr stages ii–iv sar- coidosis (p=0.012; table 4). discussion a key step in linkage and association studies is to identify common risk variants in different populations. to deter- mine if common risk variants exist in distinct populations, 15 snps which span approximately 0.53 mb of the anxa11 gene were genotyped in samples from patients with sarcoidosis and healthy controls in a chinese han population. recently, new sarcoidosis loci have been identi- ﬁed by gwass.4 14 with the fast development of gwas, an increasing number of susceptibility loci for sarcoidosis have been found in different populations.4 14 21 however, these observations should be conﬁrmed in other genetically independent populations. in this study, we conducted the ﬁrst large genetic association study of the anxa11 gene in table 1 genotypic and allelic frequencies of anxa11 polymorphisms in controls and patients with sarcoidosis variable controls (n=418) sarcoidosis (n=412) p value* or, 95% cino per cent no per cent rs2789679 0.0007 tt 114 27.3 94 22.8 0.140 1.27, 0.93 to 1.74 at 225 53.8 186 45.2 0.012 1.42, 1.08 to 1.87 aa 79 18.9 132 32.0 0.0002 0.49, 0.36 to 0.68 per a allele 383 45.8 450 54.6 0.00004 1.42, 1.17 to 1.73 rs1049550 0.0002 cc 154 36.8 208 50.5 0.0007 0.57, 0.43 to 0.75 ct 190 45.5 170 41.3 0.221 1.19, 0.90 to 1.56 tt 74 17.7 34 8.3 0.0008 2.39, 1.55 to 3.68 per t allele 338 40.4 238 28.8 0.000002 0.61, 0.49 to 0.74 rs2819941 0.0002 cc 114 27.3 94 22.8 0.141 1.27, 0.93 to 1.74 ct 226 54.1 190 46.1 0.021 1.38, 1.05 to 1.81 tt 78 18.7 128 31.1 0.0004 0.51, 0.37 to 0.70 per t allele 382 45.7 446 54.1 0.0006 1.41, 1.16 to 1.71 *p value was calculated by 2×3 and 2×2 χ2 tests based on codominant, dominant for the rare allele, heterosis and recessive for the rare allele models of inheritance. α value is adjusted by bonferroni correction and statistically significant results (p<0.003). table 2 anxa11 haplotype in block 2 frequencies and the results of their associations with risk of sarcoidosis haplotype genecounting (frequency %) id rs1049550 rs2573351 cases controls p value* global p value† hap1 t c 27.7 39.7 0.001 0.003 hap2 c c 19.9 7.4 0.0001 hap3 c t 50.5 51.0 0.892 *based on 10 000 permutations. †based on a comparison of frequency distribution of all haplotypes for the combination of snps. 4 feng x, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004466. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004466 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


a chinese han population. the evidence of markers asso- ciated with sarcoidosis was presented, and these markers were mapped to different locations in the anxa11 gene (81897864–81951001). the association signals in the region were identiﬁed, and some signiﬁcantly associated haplotypes also appeared in this region. hofmann et al4 reported an association between the t allele of the non-synonymous snp rs1049550 and sig- niﬁcantly decreased risk of sarcoidosis in a german population. similar results were also obtained in other two european populations.14 21 as a part of the sarcoid- osis gwas done in americans,22 we further conﬁrmed this association in a chinese han population. in this study, the frequency of the anxa11 rs1049550 t allele was signiﬁcantly lower in patients with sarcoidosis than in healthy controls. genotype frequency distribution revealed that, in rs1049550, the cc genotype was signiﬁ- cantly more in patients with stage i sarcoidosis than in patients with stage ii–iv sarcoidosis. the ‘protective’ effect of the anxa11 t allele increased with the number of its copies in the genotype, which is consistent with the result obtained in patients with sarcoidosis in a german population4 furthermore, the t allele carriers among patients were protected from inﬁltration of lung parenchyma (radiographic stages ii–iv).21 we have also demonstrated that rs1049550 is signiﬁcant cross- ethnically at the gene level after adjustment for the single snp association tests performed. the mechanism by which rs1049550 affects the susceptibility to sarcoid- osis is that the snp may affect the function of the anxa11 protein rather than its expression. in humans, the anxa11 protein consists of an n-terminal proline-tyrosine-glycine rich region, followed by four annexin core domains. the rs1049550 leads to an amino-acid exchange (basic arginine to a polar cysteine) at the evolutionarily conserved position 230 (r230c) in the ﬁrst annexin domain, which is responsible for the ca2+-dependent trafﬁcking of the protein in the cell.23 in the gwas conducted by hofmann et al4, the stron- gest association signal was observed for rs2789679. this marker is located in the 30-(untranslated region) utr of the anxa11 gene. the t allele had a frequency of 35% among patients with sarcoidosis and 44% in healthy con- trols, with 13% of patients with sarcoidosis and 19% of controls being tt homozygous. fine-mapping in the black women’s health study (bwhs) revealed rs2819941 to be the top snp, associated with a non- signiﬁcant (p=0.06) reduction in the risk of sarcoidosis (17% reduction per copy of the c-allele). in this case– control association study, the frequency of the a allele in rs2789679 and the rs2819941 t allele frequency in patients with sarcoidosis were signiﬁcantly higher than they were in healthy controls. several lines of evidence suggest that the observed association is unlikely to be an artefact. first, the single-snp and the haplotype-based association analyses support the current ﬁnding. second, our samples were from the same geographical region. finally, consistent results were obtained from two genetically independent populations (chinese han and europeans). collectively, our results conﬁrmed the strong association between anxa11 polymorphisms and sarcoidosis, suggesting that anxa11 represents a strong genetic risk factor for sarcoidosis. since causal snp in anxa11 was not known, all the snps signiﬁcantly asso- ciated with sarcoidosis were actually indirect associations through the real causal one. though rs2789679 and rs2819941 were not in ld with rs1049550, it may not tag the causal snp as well as rs1049550. hence, their indi- vidual effects were eliminated when controlling for the effect of rs1049550. we further investigated the interaction among poly- morphisms and observed strong ld. the haplotype ana- lysis revealed that signiﬁcantly more c–c (block 2, rs1049550–rs2573351) and signiﬁcantly fewer t–c hap- lotypes (block 2) were found in patients with sarcoidosis. these results indicated that patients with c–c (block 2) table 3 anxa11 haplotype in

haplotypes of the anxa11 gene were more prone to sar- coidosis. signiﬁcantly higher frequencies of t–c haplo- types were detected in healthy controls than in patients with sarcoidosis, suggesting that they may show protect- ive effects against sarcoidosis. our sample size can detect snp and haplotype associations with 90% and 85% power, respectively, at a false positive rate of 5%, disease prevalence of 1‰, disease allele/haplotype fre- quency of 0.05/0.03, and a presumed or of 1.5. to some extent, this ﬁnding further supports a role of anxa11 polymorphisms in sarcoidosis, while ethnic group difference may exist. in conclusion, our study suggests a potential role of anxa11 snps and their related haplotypes in the genetic susceptibility to sarcoidosis. further studies are needed to investigate how these snps affect the function of anxa11. a broader examination of the genetic vari- ation in anxa11 in the han chinese may reveal other variants associated with disease risk. contributors lgz was involved in the conception and design of the study, acquisition of patient data, genotyping and drafting of the paper. zjx and gcs were involved in the design of the study, genotyping and interpretation of results. jh and cxz were involved in the design of the study, acquisition of patient data and interpretation of results. all authors revised the draft paper. funding the project was supported by the research and development foundation of science and technology of henan province (2012k15). competing interests none. patient consent obtained. ethics approval the study was performed according to the guidelines of the medical ethical committee of xinxiang medical college (xinxiang, china). provenance and peer review not commissioned;
