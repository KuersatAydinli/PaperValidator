toxicity owing to oxidant air pollutants rising by a factor of 1.73 among the city’s inhabitants in the period leading up to 1970 as yearly average so3 levels increased. the majority of pollution-related deaths in this period was due to acute exacerbation of asthma. although patients do not commonly recover fully from pollution-related respiratory diseases, fev1/fvc ratios (calculated by dividing fev1 by fvc) may return to within the normal range once air quality is improved.4 as a result, japan passed the pollution-related health damage compensation law in 1973 with the aim of identifying designated air pollution victims within affected areas for compensation. patients with a diagno- sis of bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis or pulmonary emphysema and who had been resident in any desig- nated air pollution zone for a speciﬁed period of time were legally recognised as pollution victims. these desig- nated victims were fully reimbursed the costs of all related medical treatment by the state. however, patients’ lung function, as measured using fev1/fvc ratios, was not among the diagnostic criteria used to determine eligibility for compensation, as no agreed clinical deﬁnition for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) existed at that time. tobacco smoke has been shown to contain high levels of pm 2.5, and is likely to be associated with many health issues in common with air pollution. tobacco use has been shown to reduce lung function, as measured using fev1/fvc ratios, and has also been identiﬁed as a cause of copd and other tobacco-related diseases. the who framework convention on tobacco control was therefore adopted in 2003.5 however, tobacco use remains a signiﬁcant public health issue. according to a who report, more than 1.1 billion people globally are regular smokers.6 furthermore, asia accounts for a third of the total world cigarette consumption, and there has been a local rise in air pollution.7 both air pollution and tobacco smoke have been shown to reduce patients’ fev1/fvc ratios, to increase the risk of obstructive ventilatory defects and to exacer- bate existing respiratory symptoms. tanaka et al4 have reported that when air quality is improved, the annual change in patients’ fev1 can return to within the normal range. however, the association of ongoing tobacco use with respiratory function and pulmonary symptoms in patients with already reduced fev1/fvc ratios resulting from bronchial hypersensitivity due to air pollution has not yet been elucidated. the purpose of the present study, carried out among a population of conﬁrmed pollution victims living in a designated pollution-affected area, was to determine the association between tobacco use and measures of respiratory function and prevalence of pulmonary symp- toms for a period up to 30 years after an improvement in air quality. in particular, we sought to compare these associations in patients with and without diagnosed obstructive ventilatory defects resulting from exposure to air pollution. methods study design and setting the present study was embedded in a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of lung function and respiratory symptoms in designated victims of pollution-related illness in kurashiki between their initial evaluation (from 1976 to 1988) and follow-up in 2009. study sub- jects were drawn from the register of pollution victims in kurashiki. all study participants met the following condi- tions, as determined by the public relief system of kurashiki city, in accordance with the pollution-related health damage special measures law (1969) and the pollution-related health damage compensation law (1973): (1) they had resided or were employed within a designated air pollution zone and (2) they were diag- nosed with chronic bronchitis, asthma or emphysema by a medical practitioner. in accordance with the public nuisance countermeasures law (1967), registered victims were entitled to various forms of compensation including a monthly consultation with a doctor, yearly assessments of respiratory symptoms consisting of a detailed question- naire and spirometry tests. these patients received treat- ment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 agonists and expectorants, which may have caused improvements in lung function.8 however, this study did not collect detailed data regarding the treatment regimen, and we were therefore unable to evaluate the association between tobacco use and treatment. of the 419 203 total residents (204 958 male, 214 245 female), 3838 (0.9%) were ofﬁcially classiﬁed as desig- nated pollution victims in the period up to 1988. the records of these 3838 residents were reviewed in 2009 with the permission of the kurashiki city public ofﬁce (ﬁgure 1). of the 1392 remaining ‘ofﬁcially designated victims of pollution-related illness’, we screened 774 indi- viduals aged ≥65 years for inclusion in the study and to focus the study on elderly people. the elderly people have a higher risk factor for the onset of copd and show remarkably more respiratory symptoms of copd, as we restricted this study to patients aged over 65 years . after excluding 44 records that did not have complete spirometry data, the resulting sample size was 730 individuals. we classiﬁed patients into two groups according to whether they had an obstructive impairment by using the fev1/fvc ratios recorded at their initial evaluation. participants in each group were then further subdivided according to whether they had ever smoked or not (current smoker or ex-smoker or ever smoked)—deter- mined using self-reporting at follow-up, but we could not identify the smoking period. this resulted in four comparison groups, labelled as group a (n=48, current smokers and ex-smokers diagnosed with an obstructive impairment reporting), group b (n=169, non-smokers diagnosed with an obstructive impairment), group c (n=119, smokers and ex-smokers without a diagnosed obstructive impairment) and group d (n=394, non- 2 kotaki k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005393. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005393 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 -

smokers without an obstructive impairment). the major- ity of these patients were diagnosed with chronic bron- chitis (n=528, 68.2%), asthma (n=242, 31.3%) or emphysema (n=4, 0.5%), as described in case reports provided by authorised medical practitioners. clinical measurements patients’ gender, height, weight, body mass index, fvc, vital capacity (%vc), fev1, fev1/fvc ratios, diagnosed respiratory conditions and respiratory symptoms were all recorded at baseline and at follow-up. spirometry measurements spirometry was performed by trained staff at the mizushima-kyodo hospital using an electronic spirom- etry device (fudac 70; fukuda sangyo inc, chiba, japan). tests were performed on patients in the sitting position, and were repeated until at least three reprodu- cible forced expiratory curves had been obtained. both fev1 and fvc were measured and used to calculate fev1/fvc ratios in addition to %vc using the method proposed by baldwin et al.9 annual change of spirometric data the mean annual change in spirometry data was calcu- lated by subtracting the follow-up results from the initial evaluation results and dividing by the number of years between initial evaluation and follow-up. respiratory symptoms respiratory symptoms (including dyspnoea, asthma attacks, cough and sputum production) were assessed by physicians in the same season each year using a respira- tory health questionnaire designed by the government of japan. each symptom was graded using a standardised ﬁve-point scale. dyspnoea 1. too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing. 2. breathless after walking about 50 m or after a few minutes on level ground. 3. breathless when walking on level ground and keeping up with people of the same age, but not breathless when walking at own pace. 4. breathless when walking up a slight hill or the stairs. 5. breathless only during strenuous exercise. wheeze 1. severe episode ≥10 days each month during the last year. 2. severe episode ≥5 days each month during the last year, or mild episode ≥10 days each month during the last year. figure 1 flow chart showing the selection procedure for study subjects. the study included officially designated victims of pollution-related illness in kurashiki aged 65 years or older in 2009, and for whom full data were available for statistical analysis. ceased to experience symptoms: officially designated victims who did renew the designation because of the disappearance of clinical symptoms. kotaki k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005393. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005393 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

discussion this retrospective cross-sectional study analysed changes in respiratory function and respiratory symptoms between two points in time (initial evaluation and follow-up) among a group of designated pollution victims in japan. our results show, for the ﬁrst time, that improvements in respiratory function and reductions in respiratory symptoms are prevented by continuing tobacco use. among those patients diagnosed with an obstructive impairment due to air pollution exposure (groups a and b), we found that fev1/fvc ratios had deteriorated by follow-up with no reduction in morbidity. however, our results showed an improvement in fev1/fvc ratios in group b, which could be attributed to the high pro- portion of participants in this group diagnosed with bronchial asthma at initial evaluation when compared with the other groups. we observed that respiratory function had deterio- rated among patients in group a despite the improve- ment in local air quality, resulting in depressed fev1/ fvc ratios. furthermore, while fev1/fvc ratios in group c were relatively low at the time of initial diagno- sis, continuing tobacco use had resulted in some cases in obstructive impairment, causing fev1/fvc ratios at follow-up to decrease to 67.9±10.2%. while air pollution can cause airway obstruction result- ing in asthma, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and reduced lung function, tobacco use, which can result in airway hyper-responsiveness, has been shown to exert a stronger inﬂuence on respiratory health in a number of studies.10 11 these associations were evident in groups a and c, which showed similar annual rates of change in respiratory function over time. conversely, downs et al12 have shown that, in non-smokers, annual rates of change in fev1 can return to within the normal range in response to an improvement in air quality. these ﬁndings are similar to the results of the present study. previous studies have reported a mean annual rate of change in fev1 of between −30 and −22 ml/year in healthy, non- smoking males and females aged >65 years.13 patients with copd had a mean annual change in fev1 of 30–80 ml/year.14 however, exposure to air pollution and tobacco smoke, both of which can result in tracheobron- chial injury, can worsen annual rates of change in lung function markedly. a high proportion of our participants, particularly those with obstructive impairment, reported respiratory symptoms at baseline. these symptoms were more pro- nounced among the smokers in our sample. in group d, however, the proportion of patients reporting asthma attacks, sputum production and cough had not increased, suggesting that these symptoms may be pre- vented by smoking cessation. the proportion of partici- pants in group b reporting asthma attacks had increased by follow-up. furthermore, the proportion of partici- pants reporting asthma attacks in group c had increased to the same levels as that found in group d at initial evaluation. repeated bronchial inﬂammation caused by smoking and pollutant exposure can result in thickening of the bronchial wall and airway remodelling that cannot be reversed even by steroid treatment following the onset of hypersensitivity.12 furthermore, siroux et al15 have shown that continued tobacco use can signiﬁ- cantly increase the incidence of asthma attacks. as a result of this association, smoking is listed as a potential trigger for asthma and copd in asthma management guidelines.16 tobacco use is also likely to have been the cause of the higher prevalence of severe cough and sputum production found in groups a and c. a number of studies have shown that smoking can cause respiratory tract inﬂammation and exacerbate symptoms such as cough and sputum production.17 this was reﬂected in our ﬁnding that the severity of dyspnoea among participants in groups a and b had increased markedly at follow-up. while a number of causes of dys- pnoea have been identiﬁed, including age, poor physical ﬁtness, muscle atrophy and social and environmental factors, we could not identify the primary determinants of dyspnoea in the present study.18 finally, the progression of respiratory disease and a decline in lung function can further aggravate these symptoms.19 in asia, increased mortality and morbidity resulting from lung cancer, copd, asthma and heart disorders caused by rising atmospheric pm 2.5 concentrations is a growing public health concern. according to the organization for economic cooperation and development, air pollution is expected to become the leading cause of death worldwide by 2050, and is likely to be responsible for between three and six million deaths annually.20 furthermore, pope et al21 have reported that worldwide pollution-related deaths could rise by 6% for each additional 10 μg/m3 increase in atmospheric pm 2.5 concentrations. the present study emphasises the need to prevent or reduce air pollution and to improve public education of the negative health effects of smoking, as well as to reduce pulmonary morbidity on the population level. this is especially the case among designated victims, for whom additional education programmes, behavioural interventions and support for smoking cessation would be particularly beneﬁcial. one such behavioural inter- vention that has been proven to be cost-effective in redu- cing smoking prevalence is the ﬁve-step global initiative for obstructive lung disease framework (ask, advise, assess, assist and arrange).22 this strategy, which aims at delaying the progress of copd through continuing support for smoking cessation, may be applicable for use in similarly affected communities.23 this study has several limitations. first, information on the number of cigarettes smoked and individual-level exposure to environmental pollutants was not available. second, it was not within the scope of the present study to explore the role of gender-speciﬁc differences in exposure to tobacco smoke and pollutants, much of 8 kotaki k, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005393. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005393 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by

which may have been occupational. third, we were unable to clearly distinguish between the associations of mainstream and sidestream cigarette smoke when consid- ering the associations of air pollution and health condi- tions. finally, we were unable to account for possible confounding factors such as socioeconomic class and life- style factors, which may have resulted in individual-level differences in exposure to environmental pollutants. further work is needed to inform future prevention and treatment programmes to improve the quality of life of the remaining designated pollution victims in japan. the results of the present study are of particular import- ance in the context of high rates of smoking and wor- sening air quality in a number of asian countries as they undergo rapid economic change. acknowledgements the authors thank the study participants, technical staff, administrative support team and our co-workers for their help. we thank the environmental restoration and conservation agency and mizushima-kyodo hospital for their support. in addition, the english language in this manuscript has been edited by the edanz group ltd (fukuoka, japan). contributors hs was the principal investigator and contributed to the design of the study, administered the funding, supervised the team’s work and made critical revisions to the manuscript for intellectual content. kk designed the study, collected, analysed and interpreted the data, and prepared the manuscript. sh took part in analysing and interpreting the data, and made critical revisions to the manuscript for intellectual content. all other authors took part in data collection and interpretation, and have read and approved the final manuscript. funding this work was supported by the environmental restoration and conservation agency. competing interests none. ethics approval the study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the nagasaki university graduate school of biomedical sciences, 08072424-2. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement extra data can be accessed via the dryad data repository at http://datadryad.org/ with the doi:10.5061/dryad.17tq7. open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the terms of the creative commons attribution (cc by 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt and build upon this work, for commercial use, provided the original work is properly cited. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ references 1. ceylan e, kocyigit a, et al. increased dna damage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had once smoked or been exposed to biomass. respir med 2006;100:1270–6. 2. liu y, lee k, perez-padilla r, et al. outdoor and indoor air pollution and copd-related diseases in high- and low-income countries. int j tuberc lung dis 2008;12:115–27. 3. yang jy, xin jy, ji ds, et al.
