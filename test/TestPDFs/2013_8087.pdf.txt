 3  abstract     background: patients with dementia frequently do not receive adequate palliative care which   may relate to poor understanding of the natural course of  dementia. we hypothesized that  understanding that dementia is a  progressive and terminal disease is fundamental to a focus  on comfort in dementia, and examined how family and professional caregivers’ understanding  of the nature of the disease was associated with patients’ comfort during the dying process.    methods:  we enrolled 372 nursing home patients from 28 facilities in the netherlands in a  prospective observational study (2007-2010).we studied both the families and the physicians  (73) of 161 patients. understanding referred to families’ comprehension of complications,  prognosis, having been counseled on these, and perception of dementia as “a disease you can  die from” (5-point agreement scale) at baseline. physicians reported on this perception,  prognosis, and having counseled on this. staff-assessed comfort with the end-of-life in  dementia-comfort assessment in dying (eold-cad) scale. associations between  understanding and comfort were assessed with generalized estimating equations, structural  equation modeling, and mediator analyses.     results:  a family’s perception of dementia as “a disease you can die from” predicted higher  patient comfort during the dying process (adjusted coefficient -0.8, 95% ci -1.5;-0.06 point  increment disagreement). family and physician combined perceptions (-0.9, ci -1.5;-0.2; 9- point scale) were also predictive, including in less advanced dementia. forty-three percent of  the families perceived dementia as a disease you can die from (agreed completely, partly);  94% of physicians did. the association between combined perception and higher comfort was 


 4  mediated by families’ reporting of a good  relationship with the patient and physicians’  perception that good care was provided in the last week.    conclusions:  awareness of the terminal nature of dementia may improve patient comfort at  the end of life. educating families on the nature of dementia may be an important part of  advance care planning.        keywords: palliative care, end of life, dementia 


 5  background  the number of people living with dementia will more than triple by 2050 [1], and more  family and professional caregivers will provide end-of-life care. we studied if and how  caregiver understanding of the progressive and terminal nature of dementia relates to patient  comfort when dying.   understanding the clinical trajectory of dementia may be the basis of high-quality  palliative care at the end of life, along with the need “to diagnose dying [2,3].” qualitative  studies have indicated that families may have little understanding of the natural course of  dementia  [4,5]. a us study in nursing home patients with advanced dementia showed that if  families had limited understanding of the poor prognosis and clinical course of advanced  dementia, patients were more likely to undergo burdensome interventions [6].  retrospective  work in diverse settings in patients with terminal diseases linked recognition of dying to fewer  diagnostic and therapeutic interventions [7] and to patients more frequently being at peace  with their situation [8].  to our knowledge, no prospective work has studied the association between a lack of  understanding of the course of dementia and patient outcomes, such as comfort in the dying  process, which palliative care specialists find most important in end-of-life decision making  [9]. further, research on end of life in dementia is mostly limited to advanced dementia [6,10- 12]. many patients do not progress to advanced dementia, but die earlier from comorbid  disease or dementia-related health problems, so caregiver understanding of dementia may be  relevant in earlier stages.  we conducted a nationwide prospective study that included patients in variable stages  of dementia and studied family and  physician perspectives that influenced end-of-life care.  we assessed if family and physician understanding of the progressive and terminal nature of 


 6  dementia predicts patient comfort while dying, and if this is mediated by care processes  around family decision making [5,13], and quality of care provided. 


 7  methods  between january 2007 and july 2010,  34 long-term care facilities from each of the 12  provinces in the netherlands participated in the dutch end of life in dementia (deold)  study. data were provided from family members and physicians of patients with dementia.   the main goals were to describe treatment, care and patient- and family-level outcomes, and  factors associations with outcome [11,14]. the 28 nursing homes and 6 residential homes  with psychogeriatric units studied were selected for variability in relevant characteristics [14],  for example, facility size (ranging from 11 to 210 “psychogeriatric” beds, mostly for  dementia), and availability of a palliative care unit. these facilities represented the country  average with respect to family’s perceived quality of care as reported in public online  databases [14]. we report on 17 physician teams (28 facilities) that collected data on 372  residents with a diagnosis of dementia upon admission to the facility. the homes recruited  families and the 58% who participated were not demographically different from non- participants. the study obtained ethics approval from the medical ethics committee of the  vu university medical center (no 2006/179) and families provided informed consent before  taking part.       data collection  facilities recruited family members deemed most involved in the patient’s care  up to a year  before conclusion of data collection. families reported their understanding of the nature of  dementia eight weeks after the patient’s admission to the facility (baseline), and semi- annually. the eight-week time frame before the baseline assessment allowed for the physician  care planning meeting with the family, which is required within six weeks of admission [15]. 


 8  physicians were surveyed within two weeks of the patient’s death and families after two  months.     understanding variables  figure 1 (left box) lists the concepts used to define families’ baseline understanding of  dementia. as in previous us work [6], comprehension of complications (item 1) was defined  as  understanding the types of health problems patients may experience in the later stages of  dementia. we asked both families and physicians to estimate life expectancy (prognosis;  items 2 and 6), with response options “shorter than one month,” “one through six months,”  “seven through twelve months,” “longer than twelve months,” and “don’t know.” we  dichotomized these  categories into a prognosis of 12 months or less versus longer than 12  months and don’t know.  “having been counseled” referred to receiving information on the type of health  problems patients may experience in later stages of dementia (item 3) and on  how long the  patient may live (item 4). the general perception of whether dementia is a disease you can die  from (items 5 and 8) was assessed at baseline for the families and at a year after start of data  collection for the physicians, or soon after their employment by the participating home. this  perception was rated with five (score 1-5) response options: “completely agree,” “partly  agree,” “neither agree nor disagree,” “partly disagree,” and “completely disagree,”  with a  “don’t know” option for families only. we considered the respondent to have  agreed with the  statement if they agreed “completely” or “partly.” for regression analyses, we combined  “don’t know” with the middle category of “neither agree, nor disagree,” and we summed  families’ and physicians’ 1-5 scores resulting in total scores between 2 and 10.    possible confounders 


 9  possible confounding factors for which we adjusted were families’ highest completed  educational level (combined into a 4-level hierarchical variable) and whether the assessor of  comfort at death was a physician or a nurse since physicians may report higher levels of  comfort [16]. we also adjusted for three variables as they related to the time of the patient’s  death: families’ baseline understanding, the physician’s assessment of perception of dementia,  and time since the first death in the study, because of trends in treatment and outcome [17,18].     possible mediators  possible mediators of understanding of the progressive nature of dementia and patient  outcome were care processes and other family factors identified by caron et al. as related to  decision making such as attitudes, relationships, and interaction [5,13] (figure 1, middle box).  table 1 shows the possible mediators as defined in the deold study.   regarding care processes as possible mediators, we used indicators for palliative care  and overall assessments of quality of care to limit confounding of single treatment by patient  condition (e.g., antibiotic treatment may reduce discomfort in pneumonia [19]). similar to  previous us work [6], we defined potentially burdensome interventions as hospitalization,  emergency room visit, or new or ongoing parenteral therapy or tube feeding.     outcome  assessment of patient’s comfort during the dying process used end-of-life in dementia– comfort assessment in dying (eold-cad; staff assessment, figure 1, right box) [20], a  validated 14-item scale which assesses quality of dying [21] and has better psychometric  properties and user friendliness than other such measures [16]. total scores range from 14 to  42 with higher scores representing more comfort.    


 10  subgroups by dementia severity  dementia severity was assessed with the highly discriminative bedford alzheimer nursing  severity-scale (bans-s) [22,23]. to compare with us work [6], we also defined advanced  dementia as a cognitive performance scale (cps) [24] score of 5 or 6 and a global  deterioration score (gds) [25] of 7.    analyses  power calculations with α=0.05, r2=0.17, 80% power, icc=0.05 and a mean of 3 patients per  cluster (physician), indicated that 135 patients sufficed. we performed generalized  estimating equations (gee) regression analyses to adjust for clustering of patients with  physicians, with eold-cad-scores as the dependent variable, and understanding as the  independent variable. confidence intervals (95% ci) were calculated.  as demonstrated to be  appropriate in previous work [26], missing items, if maximum four of twelve, were imputed  with patient means to calculate a total score. later missing data on  physician’s perceptions of  dementia (11%) was mostly due to staff turnover and was imputed  in the combined  physician-family score by the mean of the—not very variable—physician’s score. analyses  were performed without imputation, and, to check for possible differences, also with simple  imputation.   we performed mediator analyses according to the macarthur approach [27]. in brief,  we examined the possible mediators assessing in adjusted gee analyses, first, if there was a  significant (p<0.05) association between the understanding variable and the possible  mediator, and, second, if there also was an association or interaction between the possible  mediator and outcome in presence of the understanding variable. we used probit, ordinal  probit, poisson, or linear regression as appropriate for the type of possible mediator being the  outcome in the first series of analyses. if associations were significant in both steps (table 1), 


 11  the mediator was tested in structural equation modelling (sem) to model multiple  associations and quantify direct and indirect effects using m-plus version 6.11 (2011). other  analyses were performed with pasw 18.0.0 (2009).  to examine possible family-physician communication and resulting consensus, we  additionally tested correlations between families’ and physicians’ understanding using  pearson’s correlation coefficients. we calculated cohen’s kappa and 95% ci for agreement  between family and physicians responding to the same dichotomous understanding items.  agreement was slight for kappa <0.2; fair, 0.2-0.4; moderate, 0.4-0.6; substantial 0.6-0.8;  almost perfect >0.8 [28]. 


 12  results  of the 372 patients, 218 (59%) died within the data collection period (figure 2). we selected  161 patients with a complete eold-cad assessment and a prospective baseline family  assessment of understanding the progressive nature of dementia.   most (69%) decedents were female; mean age at death was 86.0 (sd 6.3; table 2).  most family (64%) and physicians (61%) were also female. the physicians (73) had a mean  of 11.5 years (sd 8.1) of clinical experience in nursing homes. patients’ mean length of stay  until death was 1.0 year (sd 0.7; range 0.1-3.1 years). the mean eold-cad-score for  comfort (staff assessment) was 34.1 (sd 5.6).  less than half (41%) died with advanced dementia. causes of death listed on the death  certificate did not differ significantly between those with advanced and less advanced  dementia regarding, e.g., cachexia (23% versus 18%; p=0.44),  infection (35% versus 36%;  p=0.93), dehydration (41% versus 39%, p=0.80), or cardiovascular disease (44% versus 49%;  p=0.54), nor did it differ regarding dementia as a cause (85% versus 87%; p=0.75), as an  immediate cause (38% versus 27%; p=0.15) or a contributing cause (47% versus 60%;  p=0.12) of death.     understanding  half of families reported understanding of the complications that can occur in dementia  (table 3). only 15% of families expected death within 12 months. a minority reported having  been counseled on these issues. whereas family perceptions of dementia “as a disease you can  die from” varied (43% agreed completely or partly), almost all (94%) physicians agreed. in  39% of cases both parties agreed. over a quarter of families (28%) did not know.   there were multiple significant intercorrelations between families’ understanding  variables, for example, between comprehension of complications and the four other variables. 


 13  physician’s prognosis correlated with having counseled families on this. families’ and  physicians’ agreement on prognosis and counseling was fair (kappa 0.25; 95% ci, 0.07-0.42;  kappa 0.22; ci, 0.03-0.40, respectively; not in table). families’ and physicians’ perceptions  of dementia did not correlate (r=0.02, p=0.78). families’ perception of dementia in the last  semi-annual assessment before death (available for 84 cases) did not differ from their  perception at baseline (mean 2.6 sd 1.3 versus 2.5 sd 1.4, p=0.52 for pairwise comparison)  and the assessments over time correlated significantly (r=0.49; p<0.001; not in table).    understanding and outcome  families’ understanding of complications, prognosis, and having been counseled on these,  was unrelated to patient’s comfort when dying (table 3) as was physicians’ prognosis and  having counseled on this at admission. however, families’ perception of dementia as a disease  you can die from was associated with higher patient’s comfort in a stepwise fashion for higher  agreement (adjusted -0.8 point less comfort; increment more disagreement; ci, -1.5;-0.06).  the unadjusted eold-cad means for “completely disagree” versus “completely agree”  were 31.5 sd 5.5, versus 35.1 sd 5.6 (difference -3.6, effect size: 0.6), and the adjusted  difference was also -3.6 eold-cad points (table 3). for physicians, there was no  significant association but, qualitatively, mean comfort when treated by the few physicians  who disagreed was considerably lower. there was no stepwise decrease for those agreeing  completely versus partly; however, contrasting agreement (completely and partly) versus no  agreement, there was a significant association with comfort (unadjusted difference -4.4; ci, - 8.6;-0.1; not in table).    combined understanding, outcome, and mediation 


 14  for subsequent analyses, we combined families’ and physicians’ agreement into the 2-10  scale for perception of dementia (table 3, lowest row shows a significant association,  adjusted and unadjusted analyses were similar) reflecting relevance of both perceptions to  outcome in examining possible mediators including those referring to family-physician  interaction (gee analyses; table 1). advanced dementia did not, but dementia severity as  measured by the last bans-s assessment somewhat affected the association between  perception of dementia and higher comfort (b = -0.6, ci -1.2; 0.02). however, the association  did not differ by dementia severity (p=0.11 for interaction).    table 1 shows we examined 2 to 4 items of each of categories a-c in figure 1. a  reportedly positive relationship (warm and intense) between patient and family before the  dementia was a significant mediator regarding patient’s comfort while dying and families’  and physicians’ perception of dementia, as was physician report that good quality of  care was  provided in the week prior to death (table 1). figure 3 shows the results of sem analyses.  the two mediators remained significant in the inclusive, final model, and were significantly  correlated. the overall indirect effect was significant, although the indirect effect of the  separate mediators was not (p=0.11 and 0.08, respectively; not in figure), as was the direct  effect (p=0.053). the overall indirect effect of the two mediators explained over a quarter  (0.26/0.86) of the association between perception of the dementia and patient’s comfort.            


 15  discussion  a family’s understanding of dementia as “a disease you can die from” assessed shortly after a  patient’s admission independently predicted higher comfort in dutch nursing home patients  dying with dementia, including those with less advanced dementia. to our knowledge, this is  the first prospective study that suggests that an early basic understanding of dementia as a  terminal disease may be prerequisite to providing comfort at the end of life. even though  some die with rather than directly from the dementia, such understanding seems rational   because dementia shortens life, and death is difficult to predict [11,30]. further, many patients  never progress to advanced dementia, but we found similar causes of death for less advanced  dementia.   the difference in adjusted eold-cad-means of “completely disagree” versus  “completely agree” of nearly 4 (-3.6)  points (effect size 0.6), could imply that the dying  family member had observed, for example, pain and shortness of breath “a lot” versus “not at  all.” only about half (43%) of families agreed that dementia is a disease you can die from,  whereas 94% of physicians did. there were indications that patients were less comfortable  when treated by physicians who disagreed. we examined mechanisms whereby the combined  perceptions of families and physicians, driven mostly by the larger variability in the families’  perception, translated into higher patient comfort and found that this was mediated by higher  quality of end-of-life care as perceived by physicians and a better family-patient relationship  reported by the  family, the two of which were associated as well. closer relationships and  secure attachment styles have been associated with less increase of problem behavior over  time [31,32]. further, dutch work in cancer care found that patient’s awareness of dying was  associated with acceptance of dying [8]. possibly acceptance of dying is more difficult with a  poor family-patient relationship due to unfinished business and lack of closure. 


 16  we found no differences by stage of dementia. the other understanding items we  examined, namely comprehension of complications, prognosis, and counseling, were  unrelated to patient comfort. compared to these items, the broad perception of dementia as a  disease you can die from may be more relevant to palliative care and decision making and less  confounded by patient condition or socially desirable responding.   because consensus on prognosis and planning of palliative care is important to  physicians [3,4,33], families’ perception of dementia as a terminal disease may help  physicians in providing better end-of-life care. families’ perceptions were important even  though family views are less influential in decision making in the netherlands than in the us  due to a culture of dutch physicians being more directive [34].  in the netherlands, physicians  are based in nursing homes and work frequently with dying patients and curative interventions  are frequently withheld in dementia [12,35]. in our study, almost all physicians perceived  dementia as a disease you can die from. this may be different in other countries, where  curative interventions are commonly provided [11]. cross-national work may be important;  for example, when explored, in our dutch data we could not replicate findings of mitchell et  al. [6] of family perceptions being related to potentially burdensome treatment at the end of  life.    limitations and strengths  although associations should be interpreted as causal with caution, our  prospective study  with study patients enrollment upon admission to a nursing home was based on a previous,  thorough, conceptualization of decision making [5,13], and we employed established methods  for mediator analyses in the final step.  the perception of the dementia was measured ahead of patient’s comfort, but some  mediators were measured in parallel. multiple in-between assessments would have been 


 17  preferable. the quality of the family-patient relationship referred to the relationship before the  patient developed dementia so does not fulfill criteria for a mediator requiring temporal  precedence [27]. although we did not measure the quality of the present relationship nor the  families’ psychological conditions in detail, we feel this mediator is a proxy for current  relationship and relates to decision making. we are supported in this by our finding of trends  of family decision making in the months before death mediating the association between  perception and patient’s comfort, but power was insufficient to estimate coefficients because  such decisions were made in only about half of cases. further, we could not identify specific  treatments as mediators and physician’s perception of quality of end-of-life care was a  subjective assessment. the power to detect associations between life expectancy and comfort  was limited due to few families providing any prognosis. further, exploring possible selection  bias, we found that family comfort assessments were not different with missing staff outcome  assessment (18/179 cases), and associations with family comfort as an outcome with the  combined perception of dementia as a disease you can die from did not differ either.  however, families were more likely to disagree with dementia as a disease you can die from  when staff comfort assessment was missing, which implies we even underestimated families’  disagreement with the perception.  average length of stay (follow-up) until death was short (one year) for which we  adjusted our analyses and follow-up until death was as long as 3 years. finally, we were able  to explain a considerable part of the main association with two broad evaluations as  mediators, but not all. the association of comfort with the broad perception of dementia may  reflect a complex interplay involving multiple factors.    conclusion and implications for practice and research 


 18  we found that caregivers’ understanding of the progressive and terminal nature of dementia at  the time of a patient’s admission to a long-term care facility predicts patient comfort when  dying. such understanding may be fundamental to the provision of high-quality palliative care  at the end of life.   the difference in comfort between patients whose caregivers understand that dementia  is a terminal disease and those who do not raises the concern that patients have suffered  unnecessarily during the dying process. informing families that dementia is “a disease you  can die from,” even in  less advanced stages, may be part of advance care planning. families  themselves might also benefit if a decline in a patient’s health status triggers conversations  about dying [3] including  strategies for acceptance. a minority of physicians in our study had  counseled families despite the fact that many families did not understand the poor prognosis  in dementia. family education strategies suitable for all levels of education  [36] should be  tested as to whether they increase understanding of the natural course of  dementia, and  whether this then influences a patient’s comfort when dying. further, effects of the  acknowledging of a disease as terminal may be examined in other chronic, progressive  diseases such as chronic heart failure and copd.
