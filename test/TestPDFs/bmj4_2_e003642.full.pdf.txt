analysing spatial data, and have been pivotal in identify- ing the links between violent injury and features of social and physical environments.9 12 13 research has demonstrated that injury is strongly cor- related in space-time, and is related to features of the social and physical urban environments.12 14–16 these relationships can be further reﬁned by including a tem- poral variable. cusimano et al identiﬁed peaks in violent injury incidence at night and early morning, tending to cluster around alcohol-serving establishments, low- income housing and homeless shelters.9 10 17–21 this work differs in that we expand our analysis to include victim characteristics, the weapon of injury and a measure of social deprivation. social structure and deprivation are shown to be cor- related with violent injury.16 socioeconomic indicators and indices (eg, income inequality and employment status) tend to be strong predictors of injury risk.22 23 we examine this relationship using a deprivation index developed by bell et al.24 in this work, we focus on severe trauma as the result of interpersonal violence in vancouver, canada. speciﬁcally, we investigate how these incidents cluster in space-time, and examine how these patterns are reﬂected in the nature of the victim, the injury, the phys- ical environment and the socioeconomic deprivation level of the neighbourhood where the incident took place. data and methods injury data were acquired from the british columbia trauma registry comprising the location, date, time and cause of every injury that was treated in a trauma centre in the metro vancouver area between 2001 and 2008, inclusive. owing to data recording protocols, conﬁdenti- ality regulations, and to eliminate minor incidents, only cases with an injury severity score (iss)25 greater than 15 were included. as such, only severe injuries and injur- ies to multiple body parts were included; sports injuries and self-inﬂicted injuries were excluded. cases where the patient had expired prior to arrival at a trauma centre were not recorded in the trauma registry and are therefore excluded from this analysis. the data were classiﬁed into seven injury mechanisms: gunshot wound; sharp object trauma; blunt object trauma; bodily force (eg, punch); and other assault. a total of 575 incidents were mapped, each represented as a point in space and time. in order to determine whether an incident took place during the day or night, civil dawn and civil dusk were calculated for every day in the data period. the following variables were used in this analysis: injury location (mapped); victim age; victim sex; date and time of incident; and mechanism of injury. pearson’s χ2 test was used to determine the independ- ence of variables against day/night, and the data were graphed in relation to time of day, day-night contrast, time of year, and day of the week. these relationships were mapped in order to identify multivariate clusters (eg, night time gunshot injuries). the data were imported into geographic information systems and kernel density estimation was used to produce hotspot maps to contrast hotspots for men and women. as these data constitute a population, kernel density estimation was selected as a non-inferential inter- polation method for visualising the spatial distribution of cases. natural breaks ( jenks’ algorithm) was selected to identify areas of high concentration, and the cut-off was manually adjusted to obscure several cases’ locations. to identify spatial-temporal hotspots, the spatial scan statistic with a space-time permutation model was used.26–28 in the interest of patient conﬁdentiality, the kernel density bandwidth parameter and spatial scan window size are withheld to prevent reverse calculation. in order to explore the relationship between violent injury hotspots and socioeconomic deprivation, we used the vancouver area neighbourhood deprivation index (vandix), constructed by bell et al.24 vandix is a single quantitative metric constructed from numerous census variables in consultation with regional health spe- cialists. the deprivation score for every census dissemin- ation area was calculated, and classiﬁed into quintiles and the violent injury locations were queried in gis to identify the proportion within each deprivation quintile. findings the violent injury data comprise 518 male and 57 female victims. this disparity corresponds with ﬁndings in the literature.14 however, trauma data are certainly skewed due to the under-reporting of domestic vio- lence.29 when categorised by day/night, we found that 75% of injuries among men occurred at night, com- pared with 56% of injuries among women; the associ- ation between victim sex and day/night was signiﬁcant (χ2 p=0.002). figure 1 displays the temporal distribution. one in every three injuries in this dataset was caused by a ﬁrearm. however, weapon of choice and time/loca- tion do not signiﬁcantly correlate, matching ﬁndings in the literature.30 figure 2 divides each mechanism of injury into day/night incidence. the difference of day/ night ratios suggests that the severity of a mechanism is related to its proportional daytime prevalence. that is, an offender may feel more secure using a ﬁrearm under the cover of darkness, whereas the distinction is less con- sequential if throwing a punch. note that because these data only include severe trauma cases, blunt object and bodily force injuries are under-represented. in ﬁgure 3, incidents are categorised by day of the week. each night is deﬁned as continuous until the fol- lowing dawn; that is, saturday night continues until sunrise on sunday. this is done in order to account for alcohol consumption initiated in the evening and pro- longed through the night. this weekend spike is to be 2 walker bb, schuurman n, hameed sm. bmj open 2014;4:e003642. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003642 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


expected, but note the ‘hangover effect’: relative peace on saturday and sunday during daylight hours. figure 4, below, displays violent injury hotspots in the metro vancouver area. this pattern is similar to the dis- tribution of low-income, high-density housing in the region. the most prominent hotspot (bright red) occurs in the downtown eastside, and some minor hotspots are found in commercial zones of the outer suburbs. the linear trend from downtown to new westminster fea- tures a series of minor hotspots which occur close to skytrain stations (light rail transit) and a major shopping centre. also evident are spatial differences in female (red) and male (blue) victim hotspots. while the sample size for women is comparatively small, when mapped, some geographic differences are notable. the club district, commercial drive and the stadium feature only male victims, while victims in chinatown are all women. the circles represent cluster locations detected using the space-time permutation model of the spatial scan statistic, with the time window in which the cluster occurs. the nightclub district, the downtown eastside and commercial drive contain night-time hotspots that are particularly active on friday and saturday nights. these neighbourhoods have a high concentration of alcohol-serving establishments that feature live music and late closing times. the stadium and arena also appears as a hotspot. that this occurs during the night suggests that these cases may also be attributed to the high concentration of alcohol-serving establishments sur- rounding, and including, the stadium. when violent injury locations were compared with the vandix24 we found that 77% of all severe violent injur- ies occurred within neighbourhoods in these two most deprived quintiles. there are two notable exceptions: the club district and metrotown. while the cluster in the club district is explained by the high night-time inci- dence in proximity to alcohol-serving establishments, the case in metrotown is more complex and better explained by features of the built urban environment. discussion the ﬁndings point towards several patterns of violent injury embedded in neighbourhood characteristics. to illustrate, we thematically examine three neighbour- hoods identiﬁed in the maps above: metrotown; the downtown eastside; and the nightclub district/stadium. figure 1 temporal distribution of violent injuries through 24 h period. seventy-three per cent of incidents took place at night. note the bimodal peaks at midnight and 2:00. these peaks clustered spatially within the nightclub district (23:00–3:00) and the downtown eastside (00:00–4:00). the peak between 2:00 and 3:00 coincides with required bar closing times. figure 2 day/night comparison of violent injury counts by mechanism of injury. all injuries are more prevalent at night while firearms and injuries from sharp objects (eg, knives) are much more prevalent. the increase between day and night incidence of firearm injury is 380%, compared with 247% for sharp object and only 183% for bodily force. walker bb, schuurman n, hameed sm. bmj open 2014;4:e003642. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003642 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


metrotown: the built environment metrotown is a high-density commercial/industrial neigh- bourhood with a large shopping centre, cinema and major transit node at its core. these features are encircled by upscale, high-density housing, primarily condominium towers. similar to the club district, this neighbourhood does not have low incomes, high unemployment or a high depriv- ation index. it does not, however, have a high concentration of alcohol-serving establishments. metrotown’s appearance as a violent injury hotspot in this study may be explained by the built environment. shopping centres, transit nodes and high-density commercial development has been linked to violent injury in the literature.21 29 31 32 while the median victim age city-wide is 30, the metrotown injury cluster has a median age of 25. this may be explained by the presence of the shopping centre and cinema complex, both popular youth recreation sites. the metrotown case underscores the role of the built environment,8 18 a powerful driver of violent injury that socioeconomic and demographic indica- tors of a neighbourhood’s residents fail to represent. conversely, features of the built environment per- ceived as signs of urban decay have been linked to figure 3 day/night contrast of violent injury counts by day of week. there is a clear spike on friday and saturday nights with daytime figures remaining relatively constant throughout the week. friday night and saturday night account for one-third of all injuries. while the median age for all injuries in the dataset is 30, it drops to 25 on friday and saturday nights. this spike clusters around the nightclub district. figure 4 injury hotspots by subcategory. note that the downtown eastside is an injury hotspot regardless of the breakdown of victims. however, male victims of violent injury are spread along other corridors (eg, commercial drive) as are night-time injuries. note also the clustering of cases in the downtown eastside, a neighbourhood in the top quintile of socioeconomic deprivation. 4 walker bb, schuurman n, hameed sm. bmj open 2014;4:e003642. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003642 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


violent behaviours. examples include adult businesses,29 abandoned buildings20 and homeless shelters.21 31 while these features are not found in metrotown, they exist in high concentration in the downtown eastside. downtown eastside, socioeconomic deprivation with an average income of $c6282 (before government subsidy), vancouver’s downtown eastside has over twice the unemployment rate of vancouver and less than half the educational attainment.33 these ﬁgures do not account for the substantial homeless population.34 the downtown eastside is adjacent to the central business district, marking a stark economic divide; wilkinson and pickett23 demonstrate the extent to which inequality is a strong driver of interpersonal violence and vice versa. this strong association between socioeconomic depriv- ation and violent injury incidence coincides with similar ﬁndings in the literature.20 21 the median age of victims in the downtown eastside is 38, 8 years older than that of victims city-wide. this corresponds with the high number of elderly poor who reside in the area, and the near-absence of children. open drug and alcohol consumption are endemic, both of which have been shown in the literature to correlate with an elevated risk of experiencing violent trauma.35 there is also an extremely high number of female victims relative to the rest of the study area. given the high proportion of first nations population in the downtown eastside, relative to the remainder of the study area, this may be explained by the high rates of violence experienced by first nations women, compared with the general population.36 37 the sole female-only hotspot bordered the downtown eastside, in chinatown. while this ﬁnding certainly merits further examination, an insufﬁcient number of observations precludes the inference that this is a signiﬁcant effect. the chinatown corridor, extending south from the downtown eastside, runs along a main street with heavy pedestrian trafﬁc. as such, the observed female-only hotspot may rather be a ‘spill over’ from the downtown eastside, reﬂecting the high proportion of female victims in that area. in add- ition, it should be noted that chinatown hosts a large number of first nations residents (formal and infor- mal). future research may examine each case independ- ently to determine whether it is a similar pattern of injury. club district and stadium, alcohol consumption the links between alcohol consumption and interper- sonal violence are well established in the litera- ture.9 10 18 20 30 38 39 a 2012 study of violent trauma reports from 14 countries found that over 60% of cases were related to alcohol consumption.40 accordingly, many of the incidents in our data occurred at public binge drinking sites; brantingham and brantingham8 found a similar cluster using police data. the stadium also appeared as a hotspot, which may point towards the high concentration of alcohol-serving establishments along its perimeter; other studies have found sports sta- diums to be places of high alcohol consumption and vio- lence.41 42 while the spatial association between alcohol availability and violent trauma was anticipated, the degree to which this was observed was beyond expect- ation; spaces of excess alcohol consumption appear to be the most prevalent predictor. implications for prevention and control to examine these ﬁndings within an injury prevention and control context, we consider potential interventions actions within education, regulation, the built environ- ment and injury surveillance, recommending a compre- hensive comparative study of their effectiveness in other settings. physicians occupy a valuable position to discuss vio- lence with patients and refer them to community and health resources.43 a 1995 study, hedges et al44 found that nearly half of all repeat trauma patients were injured by the same mechanism that caused their ﬁrst visit. as such, point-of-care interventions may prove useful in behaviour modiﬁcation. however, upstream interventions hold strong potential; in this case, informa- tion posters could be placed in nightclub washrooms, a technique used in antismoking campaigns.45 however, offender-targeted campaigns have been shown in the lit- erature to have minimal effect on offender opinions or behaviours, and the management at alcohol-serving establishments may be reluctant to engage in campaigns that may discourage consumption.46 47 conversely, the who recommends campaigns targeting the cultural norms that promote violence, with an emphasis on youth education.48 such programmes would require broader policy support and an acknowledgement of the ‘lag effect’ of youth education on adult health outcomes. the most prominent temporal spike in violent injury found in this analysis data points towards the ‘closing- time’ debate. there is strong evidence that ‘last call’ policy can reduce excessive consumption and resulting harms,1 48 49 although the licensing act 2003, which allowed for longer serving hours in england and wales, appeared to have no signiﬁcant effect.50 standardised closing times may contribute to increasingly rapid drink- ing as last call approaches, leading to higher peak levels of intoxication. one policy alternative is the ‘staggered closing’ strategy, where venues may purchase liquor licenses priced along a range of closing times. this is intended to prevent high concentrations of intoxicated patrons at closing time. the who recommends strategic pricing to reduce alcohol-related harms, which has been shown both in england51 and british columbia52 to be an effective policy tool for reducing negative health outcomes.48 there were 192 gunshot trauma cases in this dataset, more than any other mechanism. however, the exclu- sion of minor injuries in our dataset inﬂates the walker bb, schuurman n, hameed sm. bmj open 2014;4:e003642. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003642 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


proportion of severe trauma, limiting any inference. the who global report on violence prevention points towards a widespread weapons availability, pointing towards background checks, safe storage regulations and more restrictive regulation.48 while canada has relatively strong ﬁrearms legislation, the majority of illegal ﬁre- arms in the metro vancouver region are smuggled from the usa or overseas.53 improved border checks are therefore a potential avenue for intervention. while increased police presence in hotspots is often recommended,31 32 54 goldstein proposes problem-oriented policing as a method that emphasises the role of the police ofﬁcer to identify underlying drivers of crime, build relationships with the citizenry and acknowledge the limits of the criminal justice system to address pro- blems.55 this approach has been tested in the ﬁeld with promising results,29 31 including ‘community policing’ in vancouver. planning and modiﬁcation of the built environment provide another direction through which violent trauma can be prevented.31 stevenson describes urban violence with the enclosure/encounter models.15 a crowded bar is an example of a built enclosure, while the crowded street at closing time causes numerous encounters, both of which can contribute to interpersonal violence. modiﬁcations could include improved nightclub design and wider sidewalks. effective injury surveillance programmes can facilitate goal-tracking43; social web technologies are a promising asset in this regard, particularly in deprived urban areas where mobile phone usage is rapidly growing.56 high-quality trauma data were vital in this and other studies. research and subsequent interventions would beneﬁt from the implementation of a broad violence surveillance programme that combines data from police, medical, schools, community resources (such as women’s shelters), legal records and other sources. in this study, we found several distinct patterns of violent injury with varying characteristics between neigh- bourhoods. as such, surveillance and intervention pro- grammes should be custom-designed for individual neighbourhoods.31 55 while education, regulation, the built environment and surveillance programmes hold strong potential to reduce violent injury in urban space, successes based on policing and accessible medical ser- vices have been quantitatively demonstrated.31 54 with the ultimate aim of injury control, a successful campaign will encompass a range of strategies to confront the issue upstream (eg, liquor policy and education) and downstream (eg, policing and ample ambulatory resources). this study is limited by the exclusion of cases with a severity score below 15; as a result, these ﬁndings are applicable only to severe trauma. further, the inclu- sion of patients who expired prior to arrival at a trauma centre may have an impact on the distribution of hot- spots. their exclusion may have led to an under- representation of gang-related violence, which caused numerous deaths during the study period. future spatial analyses of violent trauma may beneﬁt from the integra- tion of multiple data sources to include a broader range of severity and an extended temporal period. in this paper, we identiﬁed spatial–temporal patterns of violent trauma in vancouver, canada, described the neighbourhood-speciﬁc contexts within which the exam- ined hotspots are found, and discussed some potential intervention strategies. while this analysis was limited to severe trauma in one city, the ﬁndings and implications may prove useful for enriching research efforts in other urban places. however, further research should examine ways to reﬁne the gis-based methods used herein, conduct more place-speciﬁc contextual investigation and examine the efﬁcacy of intervention strategies in other study areas. acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of the british columbia trauma registry, particularly tracey taulu and nasira lakha. also acknowledged is the generous support of geoide funding (project sii-54) that made this research possible. contributors bbw conducted the analysis, interpreted the findings and drafted the manuscript;
