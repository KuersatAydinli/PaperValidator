 2    abstract     background:  all rigorous primary cardiovascular disease (cvd) prevention guidelines recommend  absolute cvd risk scores to identify high- and low-risk patients, but laboratory testing can be impractical  in low- and middle-income countries.  the purpose of this study was to compare the ranking performance  of a simple, non-laboratory-based risk score to laboratory-based scores in various south african  populations.     methods:  we calculated and compared 10-year cvd (or coronary heart disease [chd]) risk for 14,772  adults from thirteen cross-sectional south african populations (data collected from 1987-2009).  risk  characterization performance for the non-laboratory-based score was assessed by comparing rankings of  risk with six laboratory-based scores (three versions of framingham risk, score for high- and low-risk  countries, and cuore) using spearman rank correlation and percent of population equivalently  characterized as “high” or “low” risk.  total 10-year non-laboratory-based risk of cvd death was also  calculated for a representative cross-section from the 1998 south african demographic health survey  (dhs, n=9,379) to estimate the national burden of cvd mortality risk.  results:  spearman correlation coefficients for the non-laboratory-based score with the laboratory-based  scores ranged from 0.88-0.986.  using conventional thresholds for cvd risk (10-20% 10-year cvd risk),  90-92% of men and 94-97% of women were equivalently characterized as “high” or “low” risk using the  non-laboratory-based and framingham (2008) cvd risk score.  these results were robust across the six  risk scores evaluated and the thirteen cross-sectional datasets, with few exceptions (lower agreement  between the non-laboratory-based and framingham [1991] chd risk scores).  approximately 18% of  adults in the dhs population were characterized as “high cvd risk” (10-year cvd death risk >20%)  using the non-laboratory-based score.    conclusions:  we found a high level of correlation between a simple, non-laboratory-based cvd risk  score and commonly-used laboratory-based risk scores.  the burden of cvd mortality risk was high for 


 3    men and women in south africa.  the policy and clinical implications are that fast, low-cost screening  tools can lead to similar risk assessment results compared to time- and resource-intensive approaches.   until setting-specific cohort studies can derive and validate country-specific risk scores, non-laboratory- based cvd risk assessment could be an effective and efficient primary cvd screening approach in south  africa.  keywords: cardiovascular disease, prevention, cholesterol, stroke, coronary heart disease    


 4    introduction   the multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (cvd) frequently occur simultaneously in  individuals at risk. this clustering of risk factors interact synergistically to increase the level of cvd risk  to such an extent that the resulting absolute risk levels achieved is much higher than would be anticipated  when considering the individual risk factors. these patients with the highest level of absolute cvd risk  will benefit substantially if they are identified and all their risk factors diagnosed early and treated  appropriately [1]. in fact, such an absolute cvd risk approach has been shown to be more cost-effective  than treating patients’ individual risk factors to prevent cvd [2]. the calculation of the absolute cvd  risk is usually based on age, gender, tobacco use status, blood pressure levels and blood cholesterol levels  as was done with data from the framingham study [3]. a number of similar formulations of absolute  cvd risk have been proposed in a variety of settings where cohort studies were conducted to evaluate the  usefulness of absolute cvd risk scores in predicting cvd events [4-7].   the absolute risk determination approach holds particular promise for resource scarce settings  where the limited resources could best be utilized by identifying those at highest absolute cvd risk.  however, the need for blood lipid determinations for screening purposes will be far too costly in most  developing country settings with limited resources and consequently is unlikely to be adopted as policy in  these settings. this has prompted an investigation into the possibility of using other known cvd risk  factors that are easier and less costly to measure in the place of cvd risk factor that require costly  laboratory tests when calculating absolute cvd risk scores. this work compared the ability to predict   first time fatal and non-fatal cvd events in the nhanes i follow-up study cohort by two risk prediction  models: the laboratory-based framingham risk score and a non-laboratory-based model, which required  only history and physical examination measures [8]. the non-laboratory-based model used the same risk  factors but replaced total cholesterol with body-mass index and predicted cvd events equally accurately.  this suggested that the less costly non-laboratory absolute cvd risk score can effectively be used in  resource scare settings. 


 5     the exchangeability of the non-laboratory-based score with commonly-used laboratory-based  approaches has been validated in an external u.s. population [9]. in an attempt to evaluate the  effectiveness of the non-laboratory absolute cvd risk score in a developing country setting, we compared  the ranking of individuals using the non-laboratory-based score with six other absolute risk scores based  on laboratory testing in thirteen data sets of cross-sectional cvd risk factor surveys conducted in south  africa between 1987 and 2009.      methods     the main analyses in this study were based on the comparison of (10-year) individual-level  absolute cvd (or chd) risk predictions using the non-laboratory-based [8] (figure 1) and six laboratory- based risk scores [5, 10-12]. the study populations that had been used to develop each absolute risk score,  the inputs required for each score, and the composite outcome that each score was designed to predict are  described in table 1.  beta-coefficients and specific details for each score is describe in further detail in  additional file 1. among the laboratory-based risk scores, the framingham cvd risk equations are the  most well-known (globally) and commonly-used in south africa [13].  we therefore focused on the risk  characterization comparisons between the recently developed framingham (2008) cvd score [11] and  the non-laboratory score in our study, although comparisons with the non-laboratory score were  performed for all six of the laboratory-based scores.       the south african study populations used for the comparison comprised of thirteen data sets of  cross-sectional cvd risk factor surveys in random samples of participants aged 25-74 years from specific  language/geography-based populations [14-20]. data from the pure, cribsa, and phoenix study have  not been published but were provided to us from the principal investigator of each study. the data were  collected using similar standardized methods and funds for the laboratory analysis were included in the  research grants of each study. these studies were selected, in part, so we could assess potential  differences across urban/rural status, population group, and time.  table 2 outlines the study populations,  years of data collection, and basic demographics (age range and percent female) for each dataset.  


 6    because the average clinical characteristics of the phoenix dataset have not yet been disseminated, this  information was not reported in this study. the population of interest for this analysis was comprised of  the aggregate collection of 14,772 individuals from all of the thirteen south african datasets.   correlation in risk characterization was based on comparisons of individual-level, score-specific  rankings of absolute cvd risk for the non-laboratory-based score relative to the six laboratory-based  scores.  the first step in our analysis was to calculate individual-level risk predictions for each of the  seven scores included in the study.  individuals were subsequently assigned ranks for each risk score by  sex.   these ranks were used to assess correlation in dichotomous risk characterization for the non- laboratory-based score compared to each laboratory-based risk score.  using a threshold of >20% 10-year  framingham (2008) cvd risk, individuals were characterized as “high” or “low” risk for each score  based on their score-specific rank.  we then found the risk level that was equivalent to the same  proportion of events using each score.  for example, if the cvd risk score using the framingham risk  score identified 15% of the population above 20% 10-year risk then we used the equivalent risk score of  the non-laboratory risk score to identify 15% of the population.  the cuore risk score identified similar  proportions of the population as did the framingham cvd risk and the score risk score threshold of  >5% fatal events is equivalent to the framingham cvd score. an alternative threshold of 10-year  framingham chd risk >20% was also assessed.  percent agreement between the non-laboratory-based  score and each of the laboratory-based scores was calculated by adding the proportions of individuals that  were equivalently characterized as “high” or “low” risk by both scores.  spearman rank correlation  coefficients were computed for the non-laboratory-based score compared to each of the laboratory-based  scores to assess the correlations in the rankings across the full spectrum of risk thresholds.   pearson  correlation coefficients were not reported because cvd risk prediction values were not normally  distributed [21].   we also analyzed data from the 1998 south african health and demographic survey  (dhs),which has all the necessary information needed to complete the non-laboratory-based risk score  [22]. this nationally representative sample allows us to partially assess whether our results from the 


 7    cohorts might be generalizable for national primary cvd screening practice.  the analyses involving  comparison to the laboratory-based scores, however, could not be performed on the dhs data because it  does not contain the blood cholesterol values needed to compute the laboratory-based risk assessments.    as a separate analysis of interest, we computed individual-level 10-year risk of cvd death based  on the non-laboratory-based risk factors to assess the distribution of absolute cvd risk in the study  cohorts and dhs populations.  in this second analysis where we look at 10 year risk of the dhs group we  apply the cvd death only score because given the lack of a registry or widely available electronic  hospital records for non-fatal mi or stroke in south africa the only outcome that we will be able to  validate in the near future is cvd death and thus use this score for projections. we also chose cvd death  risk for these analyses to focus on the most severe events (i.e., cvd death), as opposed to softer outcomes  (such as angina events or revascularization procedures) that are harder to confirm currently in south  africa with limited registry data.  these analyses served two functions:  1) to compare the distribution of  risk in the representative dhs population to the study population; and 2) to characterize the predicted  10-year cvd mortality risk burden among south african adults.    each of the studies in south africa went through independent study reviews under the local  irb/ethics committee. informed consent was obtained from all study participants under local irb  supervision. only non-identifiable data sets were used and the ethics committee of the university of  cape town approved of the study to evaluate cvd risk.    results     table 3shows the population characteristics of thirteen south african populations included in the  main study population, the aggregate population comprised of these thirteen datasets, and representative  1998 south africa dhs population. the aggregate study population had similar characteristics to the  dhs population with respect to sex, age, and bmi, but there were observed differences regarding current  smokers (43.7% in dhs compared to 33.0%in the aggregate study population), diabetes (3.9% and 6.0%,  respectively), blood pressure treatment (8.8% and 15.0%, respectively), and systolic blood pressure 


 8    (123.9 and 133.9 mmhg, respectively).  in addition to reporting the average levels of each risk factor used  to calculated each of the individual-level risk predictions, the table includes the proportions of the  population with >20% 10-year cvd death risk based the non-laboratory-based risk factors (age-adjusted  for the who segi reference population).    the proportion of the study population at high risk (19.9%)  using this threshold was similar to the dhs population (17.9%).although the proportion of the population  at “high-risk” ranged from 10.4-26.6% across the individual study datasets, there were no observable  trends in the percent of the population at “high-risk” by urban/rural status, language, or year of data  collection.  non-african/non-coloured populations (koris and phoenix) had lower cvd risk (15.4% and  14.0%) compared to the study average (19.9%).     tables 4a and 4b display the spearman rank correlation coefficients for the non-laboratory-based  risk score compared to each of the six laboratory-based scores for each of the 13 study populations and  the aggregate dataset.  for men (table 4a) and women (table 4b) in the aggregate study population,  spearman correlation was >0.93 for the laboratory-based scores compared to scores that were intended to  predicted cvd events (i.e., all scores aside from the framingham chd function).  for comparison  purposes, a 20% framingham cvd risk and the 20% cuore score of fatal and non-fatal events is  equivalent to the score risk of 5% for fatal events only. in general, the correlation coefficients were  highest for the non-laboratory-based score compared to the score and cuore functions, followed by  the framingham cvd scores, then the framingham chd score.  the ranges of correlation coefficients  across the 13 study populations for the non-laboratory-based score compared to the framingham (2008)  cvd score were 0.877-0.964 (in men) and 0.888-0.950 (in women).  similar results were seen for the  other risk scores with few exceptions.   figures 1a (for men) and 1b (for women) plot individuals in the aggregate study population based  on rankings of risk (in ascending order) for the non-laboratory-based (vertical axis) and framingham  (2008) cvd (horizontal axis) risk scores.  based on a risk threshold that corresponds to 10-year  framingham (2008) cvd risk >20%, there was 89.8% and 93.9% agreement in risk characterization  between the non-laboratory-based and framingham (2008) cvd risk scores, for men and women, 


 9    respectively.  tables 5a (for men) and 5b (for women) show the complete risk characterization agreement  results for the non-laboratory-based score compared to each of the six laboratory-based scores, and for  each of the 13 study populations in addition to the aggregate study dataset.  the risk characterization  agreement findings were similar to the spearman rank correlation results both in terms of higher  agreement/correlation with cvd scores (as opposed to the framingham chd score).  figure 2 shows the distribution of 10-year non-laboratory-based cvd death risk in the aggregate  study and the representative 1998 south africa dhs populations by sex(age-adjusted to who segi  reference population).  the largest proportion of each population belonged in the <10% risk group,  although 30% of the populations had 10-year non-laboratory-based cvd death risk >10%.   approximately 2-3% of each population was at greater than 60% 10-year risk of dying from cvd.   figure 3 shows the percent of the same populations that were above selected 10-year cvd death risk  thresholds based on non-laboratory-based risk factors.  over 17% of individuals in each population were  at greater than 20% 10-year cvd death risk (which is close to the general recommended risk thresholds  for treatment for medium-income countries), and 4-6% of the aggregate study populations were at greater  than 40% 10-year cvd death risk [23]. the aggregate study population had slightly more individuals at  higher risk in the lowest category considered (>20% risk), while the proportions of the aggregate study  population above each threshold >25% were similar to the dhs population (the differences were less than  3.3% for each threshold, in absolute terms).  there were small differences in the gender comparisons,  with the aggregate study population having slightly higher proportions of men at high risk compared to  the dhs population (women were similar across these populations).    discussion    in this study, we found that a non-laboratory-based cvd risk score when compared to six  versions of laboratory-based framingham, score, and cuore equations, similarly ranked individuals  and characterized cvd risk in all 13 cohorts studied. we observed strong agreement in risk  characterization between the non-laboratory-based and laboratory-based scores in all the cohorts. this 


 10    was true for the aggregate of the cohorts and in each of the cohorts, which had a wide range of overall risk  suggesting the non-laboratory-based risk tool performs as well in low-risk groups as it does in high-risk  populations.  the greatest agreement was with the score risk tool with over 96% agreement in both  men and women.  over 92% of men and 97% of women were equivalently characterized as “high” or  “low risk” by non-laboratory-based and laboratory-based scores using a risk threshold based on a  threshold commonly used in guidelines (10-year chd risk >20 [24]. at a risk of 5% in both the high and  low risk populations, the score equation is equivalent to the fatal and non-fatal threshold of 20% for  framingham cvd risk.    correlation at the cvd risk threshold of >20% was highest for the laboratory-based cvd  outcome scores, with the older framingham chd only score slightly lower.  in general the correlation  was greater for women than with men. in men, using the ’91 framingham chd score, the correlations for  two cohorts, aha-fs rural and the pure urban, were slightly lower, (0.797, 0.751 respectively). this is  important as there has been a movement for risk prediction tools to include both stroke and ischemic heart  disease given many low and middle income countries, including south africa, have a higher proportion of  stroke of the total cvd events. further, reductions in most risk factors for ischemic heart disease also  reduce stroke and thus a risk prediction tool including both is more in line with clinical activities.   however, this level of correlation is still considered “high correlation” being greater than 0.7 if not “very  high correlation” for correlations greater than 0.9. [25]   the ability to assess risk without the requirement of expensive laboratory blood tests is important  in many low-income settings for multiple reasons.  the first includes its ability to correctly classify  patients at the thresholds that most prevention guidelines choose for initiating treatment.  other  considerations include practicality, cost, feasibility-in particular providing clinicians with the opportunity  to make a treatment decision during a  single clinic visit. this obviates the need for a laboratory test and a  second patient visit to review the results and plan management with a resultant reduction of costs and the  potential for non-attendance for the follow up visit. the cost of cholesterol testing and the follow-up  clinic visit in south africa is over us $30.  testing for cholesterol for the adult population even at a 


 11    frequency every 5 years would cost annually $110 million. the annual cost of treating a patient on  generic simvastatin can be less than $20[26] (less than the cost of testing and follow-up visits)  which on  annual basis for all those above 20% 10 year risk would equal nearly $60 million.  thus money saved  from excessive lab-testing can easily offset the cost of treating those at high risk with an additional  savings of nearly $50 million. in addition to these savings would be the additional premature deaths and  disabling myocardial infarctions and strokes prevented.  furthermore, patients, their family or members of  the public, with access to a blood pressure device, can calculate their own risk and present to facilities for  further evaluation.  this opens the up the potential for increased opportunistic screening. furthermore, it  could lead to improved risk stratification for those who may be treated so that limited medications go to  those who need it most.  using the non-laboratory-based screening tool, nearly 18% of the dhs and aggregate study  populations would have a 10-year cvd death risk greater than 20%.  what is striking is that using the  1998 demographic health survey population, the risk for women is only slightly lower than for men,  which is not the case for most developed populations where men have a considerably higher risk at least  through the middle-aged populations.  however, in the dhs and in many of these cohorts included in the  analysis, while the smoking rates tend to be higher for men, the opposite is true for diabetes and obesity  and hypertension in the elderly.  the obesity rates are almost double and the diabetes rate is nearly 50%  greater for women than for men [27]. these differences suggest that south african women in particular  could be facing a greater burden compared to men particularly as smoking rates for men continue to  decline.  one limitation of our analysis is that the risk discrimination and validation performance of the  non-laboratory-based risk score has not been validated in a longitudinal south african cohort study. the  lack of reliable death data for these cross-sectional cohorts make it impossible at this time to validate any  prediction score for cvd death. having a cohort study with death data would also allow us to assess the  level of correct classification and misclassification between the different risk scores.  it is also possible  that the non-laboratory-based risk score may over or underestimate the true risk, but that is true for all the 


 12    risk scores compared in the analysis.  this is also true for most individual risk factors that developing  countries base their guidelines on.  unfortunately, few low-income countries have cohort data to make  these estimates.  no risk score has been validated in south africa, nor for that matter in most populations  in low- and middle-income countries, except for china [28].  however, studies to validate the risk score  are ongoing in south africa but this data will not be available for nearly 5 years. however, the clinical  need to risk stratify patients exists now.  our results suggest using the non-laboratory-based scores will  classify people similarly in the meantime as those which rely on laboratory-based information—neither of  which have been validated in developing countries. previous analysis in the us has shown that less than  7% disagreement occurs in risk classification.[9] further, the who/ish risk charts have not been  validated in individual country populations but are being promoted for screening.  however, all the scores  we evaluated will identify the same high risk people.  so if a country is using one of the laboratory based  risk tools, it could substitute it for a non-laboratory based tool and identity the same group for less cost.  the who/ish risk charts were not included in our analyses because the underlying risk functions are not  publicly available.[23]  in summary, we found that a non-laboratory-based cvd risk assessment tool ranked individuals  nearly identically compared to risk scores that require additional expensive cholesterol tests.  using the  non-laboratory-based risk assessment tool, we estimate that nearly 20% of the south african adult  population is at high cvd risk.  health care providers that have limited resources and time in  overcrowded primary health centers in south africa can assess risk and make treatment decisions in a  much more timely and inexpensive manner with similar results as those using blood based risk tools.   further, this risk factor information can be obtained non-invasively in about 5-10 minutes. this initial  screening without blood testing could lead to the quick initiation of treatment without the added cost or  inconvenience of laboratory testing.  this would also minimize any potential loss to follow-up due to the  extra step in testing.
