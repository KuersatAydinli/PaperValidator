2      abstract  background  hypnotics are widely used by the elderly, and their impact on mortality remains controversial.  the inconsistent findings could be due to methodological limitations, notably the lack of  control for underlying sleep symptoms or illness associated with hypnotic use, e.g. insomnia  symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness, depression and anxiety. our objective was to  examine the association between the use of hypnotics and mortality risk in a large cohort of  community-dwelling elderly, taking into account a wide range of potential competing risks  including sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and chronic disorders as well as  underlying psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints.  methods  analyses were carried out on 6696 subjects aged 65 years or older randomly recruited from  three french cities and free of dementia at baseline. adjusted cox proportional hazards  models with delayed entry, and age of the participants as the time scale, were used to  determine the association between hypnotic use and 12-year survival.   results  at baseline, 21.7% of the participants regularly used at least one hypnotic. during follow-up,  1307 persons died; 480 from cancer and 344 from cardiovascular disease. analyses adjusted  for study center, age and gender showed a significantly greater risk of all-cause and  cardiovascular-related mortality with hypnotics, particularly benzodiazepines, and this  increased with the number of hypnotics used. none of these associations were significant in  models adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, chronic disorders including  cardiovascular pathologies, sleep and psychiatric disorders. results remained unchanged 


3    when duration of past-hypnotic intake or persistent vs intermittent use during follow-up were  taken into account.  conclusions  when controlling for a large range of potential confounders, the risk of mortality was not  significantly associated with hypnotic use regardless of the type and duration. underlying  psychiatric disorders appear to be the principal confounders of the observed association.

5      background  sleep changes with advancing age; however the high prevalence of insomnia in the older  adult population is often due to associated age-related medical and psychosocial comorbidities  and the frequent use of medications that may impact sleep per se [1]. insomnia symptoms in  older adults are frequently associated with daytime fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness  (eds), and hypnotics use [2-4]. insomnia and eds are also frequently comorbid with other  pathologies, notably cardiovascular diseases (cvd) [5, 6] and psychiatric disorder, e.g.  anxiety and depression [2, 4, 7].   hypnotics are indicated for treating insomnia symptoms, including those associated with  anxiety and depression, and may also be used together with antidepressant treatment. the  current use of hypnotics in the general population is estimated to range between 3.5% and  11.7%, and more doubling in elderly populations [8-11]. hypnotics may produce residual  daytime sleepiness and impairment of psychomotor, attention and memory performances the  day following bedtime administration, especially with the high dose and long half-life  durations [12]. moreover the use of hypnotics seems associated with excess risk of accidents  such as falls and car accidents [12] and may increase mortality risk, especially in elderly  people with increased pharmacodynamic alterations.  however, the high rate of insomnia, eds complaints, and psychiatric disorder in the elderly,  their frequent comorbidity and the potential risk of mortality associated with both sleep  disorder [13] and psychiatric disorder [14, 15], may override hypnotics per se as the cause of  increased mortality, independently of the underlying burden of illness.  overall, evidence suggesting an association between hypnotics consumption and mortality in  the elderly, remains controversial. four observational studies in young adults [16, 17] and  elderly people [18, 19] found no significant associations between hypnotics and all-cause 


6    mortality. other studies reported a significant association with excessive all-cause deaths in  adults [20-22]. two large studies with very wide age ranges from young adult to older elderly  [23-25] found significant associations in all age-groups including the elderly. most of the  above studies controlled for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and some chronic  disorders but rarely or not at all for the underlying medical conditions associated with  hypnotic prescription i.e. depression, antidepressant use, anxiety, insomnia and eds. finally,  no studies examined the cumulative effect of hypnotics or the impact of its long-term use on  mortality risk in an elderly population specifically. several methodological issues may  contribute to the observed inconsistencies, including (i) the design of the study (retrospective  or prospective), (ii) the duration of follow-up (between 2.5 and 20 years), (iii) the  heterogeneity in sample size and age range, (iv) the type and duration of hypnotic  prescription, as well as (v) the lack of control for psychiatric and sleep disorders (prescription/  indication biais).  the aim of the present study is to examine the associations between the use of hypnotics and  12-year mortality risk (all-causes, cancer and cardio-vascular disorders) in a large cohort of  community-dwelling elderly, taking into account a wide range of potential competing risks  including sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and chronic disorders as well as  underlying psychiatric disorders, eds, and insomnia complaints. the impact of duration and  type of hypnotic treatment were also evaluated.    methods  study population   subjects were recruited as part of the three-city study, an ongoing multi-site longitudinal  study involving three french cities, bordeaux, dijon and montpellier [26]. briefly, non-


7    institutionalized subjects aged 65 years or over were randomly selected from electoral rolls  between 1999 and 2001. the acceptance rate was 37%, yielding a sample of 9294 subjects.     the study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the university hospital of  kremlin-bicêtre and cpp sud méditérannée iii, and written informed consent was obtained  from each participant. the participants were administered standardized questionnaires and  underwent clinical examinations at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12 years.   mortality  the exact date of death of the participants was obtained from death registries. the causes of  death were collected by the local study centers from medical records and interviews with  family physicians, clinicians and other non-medical informants (relatives or caregivers) [27].  a validation committee used all information to classify the cause of death using the tenth  revision of international classification of diseases (icd-10) [28] as follows; cancer (icd-10:  c00 to c97 and d37 to d48), cvd and stroke (icd-10: i00 to i99 and r960 to r961),  respiratory (icd-10: j00 to j99) and ill-defined causes (icd-10: r00 to r99).   socio-demographic and clinical variables at baseline  the standardized interview included questions on demographic characteristics, level of  education, living alone and on health behaviors (e.g. consumption of alcohol and smoking  status). information on the health of the participants was obtained through detailed medical  questionnaires. case-level depressive symptoms were defined as a score above the 16-point  cut-off on the center for epidemiological studies–depression scale (ces-d) [29]. anxiety  trait symptoms were measured using the spielberger’s state-trait anxiety inventory (stai)  [30]. in the absence of a validated cut-off score in elderly populations, the state score was  divided into tertiles with the highest tertile (higher level of anxiety) being compared to the 


8    two lowest tertiles. global cognitive function was assessed by the mini-mental state  examination (mmse) [31] and participants scoring less than 26 were classified as cognitively  impaired. confinement was defined as social restriction (confinement to bed, home or outings  restricted to the neighborhood) [32]. body mass index (bmi) was calculated as weight (kg)  divided by height squared (m2). the presence of hypertension was defined by measured  systolic blood pressure (bp) ≥160 mmhg or diastolic bp ≥95 mmhg or current  antihypertensive treatment. diabetes was defined as fasting glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/l or  treatment for diabetes. hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol level ≥6.2  mmol/l or treatment with lipid lowering agents. detailed medical questionnaires included  past history of respiratory and thyroid disorders, and cardio-cerebrovascular disease (angina  pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular surgery, arteritis and stroke) established  according to standardized questions.   sleep complaints at baseline  sleep complaints were assessed at baseline as part of the clinical interview, followed by the  completion of a specific sleep questionnaire [33]. the participants self-rated as “never, rarely,  frequently, or often” occurrence of 1) being excessively sleepy during the day (eds), 2)  having difficulties in initiating sleep (dis), 3) having several awakenings during the night  (dms), 4) having early morning awakening (ema) without being able to go back to sleep,  and 5) snoring loudly. in this analysis, eds was defined as reporting frequently/often being  excessively sleepy. insomnia complaints based on dis, dms and ema were dichotomized as  frequently/often versus never/rarely and summed up to obtain a number of insomnia  complaints ranging from 0 to 3. the “risk” of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas) was  defined clinically as being obese (bmi ≥30kg/m2), with frequent/often eds, and  frequent/often loud snoring. 


9    medications and hypnotic use  at baseline and at 2, 4, 8-year follow-up, an inventory of all prescriptions and over-the- counter drugs used during the preceding month was included in a standardized interview.  medical prescriptions and the medications themselves were checked by the interviewer thus  minimizing exposure misclassification. current use of antidepressants and hypnotics were  coded according to the world health organization’s anatomical therapeutic chemical  classification [34]. hypnotics were classified as; benzodiazepines (bzd), bzd-like  compounds (zolpidem, zopiclone), and miscellaneous medications (including barbiturates,  antihistaminics, and other pharmacological categories such as neuroleptics). at baseline, the  participants currently taking hypnotics were also requested to report the duration of hypnotic  intake.   statistical analyses   logistic regression models were used to compare the characteristics of participants according  to the use of hypnotics at baseline after adjustment for study center, age, and gender. to  analyze the associations between hypnotic use and risk of mortality, cox proportional hazard  models with delayed entry and age of the participants as the time scale were used to estimate  hazard ratios (hr) and their 95% confidence intervals (ci). this method gives better  adjustment for age and is therefore preferable for an elderly sample over the standard model  which uses study time as the time scale as the covariates are strongly associated with age (e.g.  chronic diseases) [35, 36]. multivariate models included covariates that were associated with  mortality at a conservative level of p<0.15. model 1 was adjusted for study center, age and  gender. model 2 was further adjusted for education, alcohol intake, smoking status, bmi,  confinement, respiratory disorder, cognitive impairment, history of cvd, hypertension and  diabetes. two other models were adjusted for diseases associated with hypnotic use in order  to take into account possible prescription bias, e.g. number of insomnia complaints and eds 


10    (model 3) and anxiety, depressive symptomatology and antidepressant use (model 4). the  multivariate model 5 was adjusted for all possible confounders. all-cause mortality was the  principal outcome defined for the analysis. in secondary analyses, cause-specific mortality  due to cvd and cancer was analyzed for separate end points. if both cvd and cancer were  reported as cause of death, both causes were considered in the analysis. in all final models,  significance level was set at p<0.05. analyses were performed using sas statistical software  (version 9.2; sas inc, cary, north carolina).  results  study population   as shown in the study diagram (figure 1), the study sample included 6696 participants free of  dementia (58.7% women) with a median (min-max) age of 72.8 years (65.0 to 95.0). the  2382 subjects free of dementia excluded from the study were significantly more likely to be  older, had a lower education level, more frequently female and living alone, with  confinement, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease, hypercholesterolemia, depressive  and anxiety symptoms, cognitive impairment, past history of cardio-cerebrovascular disease,  and taking more hypnotics (p<0.05 for all comparisons). they were also more likely to have  died during the follow-up period (p<0.0001).  at baseline, 21.7% (n=1454) of the participants were taking at least one hypnotic, 6.9%  (n=464)had three insomnia complaints and 3.9% (n=260) no insomnia complaints. more than  3% (n=212) reported taking two or more hypnotics. regarding the main classes of hypnotics,  16% (n=1070) took bzd, 4.8% (n=321) bzd-like compounds, and 3.0% (n=204)  miscellaneous medications (of whom 54.4% antihistaminics, 25.0% non-bzd anxiolytics,  18.6% barbiturates, and 4.4% neuroleptics). with regard to duration, 4.8% (n=304) had been 


11    taking hypnotics for less than 5 years, 3.9% (n=244) between 5 and 10 years, 2.0% (n=127)  between 10 and 20 years and 6.0% (n=378) for more than 20 years. .  baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants according to  hypnotic use are described in table 1. analysis adjusted for study center, age and gender,  showed that participants taking hypnotics had a lower education level, were more likely to be  confined to home, had more symptoms of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment, had  more frequently a past history of chronic disease (cvd, thyroid disease, diabetes,  hypercholesterolemia), consumed less caffeine and reported more insomnia complaints and  eds (p<0.05 for all comparisons).  association between hypnotic use and 12-year mortality  the median follow-up time for the study was 8.9 years with a range of 0.06 to 11.7 years.  during this period, 1307 (19.5%) deaths were observed. they were particularly related to  cvd (26.3%), cancer (36.8%), and co-morbid cvd and cancer (3.1%). a substantial number  of deaths were due to ill-defined causes (21.6%) as the result of multiple pathologies  associated with frailty, and 10.2% died from respiratory diseases.  baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in relation to follow-up mortality (all  causes) are given in table 2. participants who died during follow-up were more frequently  confined to home, obese, past or current smoker, consuming less alcohol, had hypertension,  diabetes mellitus, a past history of cvd, respiratory disease, poorer cognitive performance,  eds, depressive symptoms or were taking antidepressants. they also tended to have a lower  level of education, and more frequently reporting insomnia and anxiety symptoms (p<0.15).  subsequent analyses were adjusted for these factors. a significant association was also found  for subjects “at risk” of osas (n=133) (hr=1.76, 95%ci=[1.31-2.36], p=0.0002).  table 3 shows the associations between hypnotic use at baseline and all-cause mortality over  the 12-year follow-up. after adjustment for age, gender, and study center, the risk of all-cause 


12    mortality increased significantly with the use of any hypnotic, the number of hypnotics, and  alone for bzd (p<0.01 for all comparisons, model 1). when potential lifestyle and chronic  disorder confounders were further entered into the model (model 2), the hr were reduced and  failed to be significant except for bzd (p=0.05) and this was unchanged when further  adjusting for sleep complaints (model 3). on the other hand, when adjusting for anxiety and  depressive symptomatology (model 4) the associations were not significant even for bzd  (p=0.22) and this was also the case for the complete multivariate model adjusted for all  potential confounders (model 5). bzd-like compounds, and miscellaneous medications intake  were not associated with all-cause mortality even in the minimally adjusted model 1. no  significant interaction was found for mortality between hypnotic use and 1) eds, 2) number  of insomnia complaints, 3) antidepressant use, 4) chronic diseases and 5) being “at risk” for  osas.   the relationship between hypnotic intake and the risk of mortality remained unchanged after  exclusion of the participants who died during the first two years of follow-up (n= 134), the  follow-up rate at two years being 88%.. with regard to specific causes of death, the use of  hypnotics and bzd, as well as number of hypnotics were associated with a significantly  increased risk of cvd-related death in model 1, but not in the complete multivariate model  adjusted for all potential confounders (table 4). there was no significant association between  hypnotics and cancer-related death regardless of covariates, even in the minimally-adjusted  model 1 (p=0.38).   duration of hypnotic use and mortality  sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the relationship between persistent use of  hypnotics during the initial 4 years and all-cause mortality. a total of 3496 participants  (65.9%) did not report hypnotic use at baseline or at follow-up examination, 773 (14.5%)  reported use both at baseline and at all two follow-ups (persistent users) and 1040 (19.6%) 


13    were taking hypnotics at one of two time points (intermittent users). the risk of mortality for  the next 8 years was not significantly associated with the persistent use of hypnotics (when  compared with non-users, hr=1.03 95% ci=0.84-1.28 for intermittent users, hr=1.11  %ci=0.88-1.39 for persistent users, in multivariate model 5). similar results were obtained  when the analyses focused on persistent bzd users in comparison to non persistent bzd- users or non-bzd-users.  we also examined the impact of past hypnotic intake duration and compared subjects who  were not taking sleep medication at baseline with those having previously reported taking  sleep medications (i) for less than 5 years, (ii) between 5 and 10 years (iii) between 10 and 20  years and (iii) for more than 20 years. no significant association was observed between  duration of hypnotic intake and all-cause mortality, the global p-value ranging from 0.18  (model 1) to 0.76 (model 5) (data not shown).   discussion  this study examined associations between hypnotic intake and risk of excess mortality (all- causes and specific-causes) over a 12-year period in a large elderly cohort, taking into account  a wide range of potential confounding factors. as in several previous studies we observed  significant associations between hypnotic use, notably bzds, and mortality; however these  associations became non-significant after adjustment for all potential confounding factors,  notably psychiatric disorder. these findings persisted even after taking into account up to 20  years duration of past-hypnotic intake or persistent vs. intermittent use.   previous studies have been inconsistent with some studies observing significant relationships  between hypnotic prescriptions and mortality [16, 20-25, 37] and others not [16-19]. our  findings suggest that these differences are probably largely due to failure to take into account  confounding associations, notably common affective symptoms and sleep complaints, 


14    although other factors such as study design, participant age, and class of hypnotics probably  also influence study outcome.   insomnia symptoms often lead to the use of hypnotics, a condition frequently associated with  eds, anxiety and mood disorders. depression and anxiety are also risk factors for mortality  [14, 15]. depressive symptomatology and insomnia are both common in the elderly and in  france there are no official guidelines for management, such that antidepressants are often  used to treat sleep disorder and hypnotics to treat depression, especially where sleep  disturbance is one of the presenting symptoms [2]. eds is also of multifactorial origin, and  commonly associated with depression [7], cognitive decline [38], physical illness (particularly  cardiovascular disease), and mortality in older adults [5, 6, 13]. thus, all these conditions may  increase the risk of mortality in elderly subjects through pathways independently of hypnotics.  however, few previous studies have controlled for psychological status [17, 18, 22, 23] and in  studies where depressive symptoms have been considered, antidepressant use has not been  necessarily taken into account. this is important as antidepressant use may relieve depressive  symptomatology, but the underlying biological risk factors associated with increased  mortality may still be operating. no previous studies have controlled for anxiety or  simultaneously for insomnia and eds symptoms as potential independent confounding  factors. to our knowledge, our study is the first one controlling for such a large range of  potential confounding factors, especially the underlying diseases associated with hypnotic  use, e.g. anxiety and depressive symptomatology, antidepressant use, as well as eds and  insomnia complaints. our finding that psychiatric disorder could be a principal determinant  driving the association between hypnotics and mortality risk explains previous  inconsistencies.  chronic use of hypnotic drugs particularly bzd may be associated with the risk of addiction  and insomnia-rebound after withdrawal, psychomotor impairment and cognitive problems, 


15    osas, eds, and car accidents [12, 39, 40]. in our sample, only one subject died from a car  accident, and this person did not use hypnotics. we did not find any interaction between  subjects clinically “at risk” for osas, hypnotics intake and mortality, suggesting that if  hypnotics may trigger or aggravate osas they did not impact on mortality risk. the use of  bzd may also favor falls and hip fractures and thus increase the risk for disability and death  especially in the elderly [41, 42]. however some studies have suggested that nighttime sleep  problems per se may also be significant risk factors for falls in the elderly, independently of  hypnotic use [43-45]. in our study, the associations between hypnotic use and all-causes or  cvd-related death became non-significant after adjustment for health behavior and status  variables, plus eds and insomnia complaints.   an increased incidence risk for cancer was also reported in subjects using hypnotics in some  studies [21, 22, 24], even in infrequent hypnotic users [22]. our study did not report any  association between hypnotic use and cancer-related death. again, differences in adjustment  of underlying co-morbid conditions frequently associated with the chronic use of hypnotics  appear to explain previous findings.  the present study has some limitations. unfortunately, data related to hypnotic dose was not  available. bias could have been introduced by the low participation rate at baseline, the non- random exclusion of participants with missing data at baseline, who were older, were more  commonly hypnotics users and more often had psychiatric and other chronic disorders that  may limit the generalizability of our findings. although unlikely, the possibility of  overadjusment could not be excluded: potential confounding variables should be intermediate  variables in the causal pathway between hypnotics intake and mortality. finally, the absence  of significant association between the use of hypnotics and mortality (all-causes, and cardio- vascular disorders) after adjustments for covariables should be interpreted with caution  regarding the small number of events per predictor variable. 


16    our prospective study based on a large community sample has several strengths, including the  duration of the follow-up and adjustment for a wide range of possible confounding factors  including socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, chronic disorders, sleep complaints as well  as depression and anxiety disorders which were found as key confounding factors in this  study. prescriptions and medications themselves were checked by the interviewer and the  causes of death were established by an independent committee. finally, excluding participants  who died during the first two years of follow-up did not modify the main results, suggesting a  modest confounding effect of severe undiagnosed conditions in relation to hypnotic use and  death.  conclusions  our findings suggest that the use of hypnotics is not independently associated with an  increased risk of mortality in the elderly, and that previous findings may be largely  attributable to failure to take into account confounding variables, notably clinical co- morbidity which is frequent at higher ages, particularly psychiatric disorders. use of  hypnotics might be a marker underlying more complex health issues.    list of abbreviations  bmi: body mass index  bp: blood pressure  bzd: benzodiazepines  ces-d: center for epidemiological studies–depression scale  ci: confidence interval;   cvd: cardiovascular diseases  dis: difficulties in initiating sleep  dms: difficulties in maintaining sleep
