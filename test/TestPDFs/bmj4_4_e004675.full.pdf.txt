routine mortality data. we previously reported the 10-year prognosis of all patients in the echoes study according to presence or absence of hf and lvsd.12 this analysis uses data from echoes to examine the role of nt-probnp in predicting a diagnosis of hf at screening and also the relationship between nt-probnp and survival in the following decade. methods the original echoes study screened a total of 6162 participants from 16 practices in central england. four practices were randomly selected from each of the four socioeconomic groups deﬁned using the townsend deprivation score. this resulted in a socioeconomically diverse population, likely to be representative of the broader uk population. echoes included four separ- ate cohorts: 3960 patients randomly sampled from the general population over age 45; 782 patients with a pre- vious label of hf recorded in general practitioner (gp) notes; 928 patients on diuretic therapy and 1062 with known risk factors for heart disease (hypertension, dia- betes, angina, history of myocardial infarction (mi)). the four cohorts were stipulated prior to the study and searches were carried out to ﬁnd patients in each of these groups using general practice records. patients underwent assessment (history, examination, ecg and echocardiography) to screen for evidence of hf. a substudy involving 594 echoes participants was also carried out to investigate the role of nt-probnp in diagnosis and prognosis of hf. fuller methods are avail- able in an earlier publication11 but in brief, participants came from four general practices, across the townsend scale; 309 were sampled from the general population, 103 with a previous label of hf, 88 on diuretic therapy and 134 with risk factors of heart disease with some patients belonging to more than one cohort. during the echoes study, which ran from march 1995 to february 1999, the records of all participants were ﬂagged by the ofﬁce for national statistics (ons) central register ofﬁce. the ons has provided details of the date and cause of death for all echoes partici- pants since then. the ﬁnal participant in the original echoes cohort was screened on 25 february 1999 and all deaths up to 25 february 2009 had been notiﬁed to the research team. this allowed an estimate of 10-year prognosis for patients in echoes including those from the nt-probnp study. all data from the original echoes cohort were recorded in a restricted access database. the statistical packages spss and stata v.10 were used to analyse the data. analytical methods area under the receiver operating curve (auroc) was calculated for each cohort to measure the natriuretic peptide’s performance in predicting hf at screening. multiple logistic regression was then performed, using all cohorts combined, to examine whether bnp was predictive of hf, after adjustment for the sampling struc- ture and other signiﬁcant predictors. variables in the ﬁnal model were selected using the backward elimin- ation method with signiﬁcance level set at 0.05. variables considered in the analysis included nt-probnp, age, sex, body mass index (bmi), smoking status, blood pressure, individual risk factors for hf (hypertension, angina, mi, diabetes), symptoms (tired- ness, shortness of breath, ankle oedema), prescribed drugs (β-blockers, ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics) and whether a previous label of hf was recoded. two-way interactions with natriuretic peptide were also considered. the cohort-related vari- ables were kept in the ﬁnal model to allow for the sam- pling structure. to improve the precision of the estimates, bootstrapped cis for ors were calculated using 1000 replications. survival analysis was carried out by each cohort using kaplan-meier curves to demonstrate survival in those with an nt-probnp level ≥150 pg/ml. log rank tests were used to compare survival between the different groups. the mean survival times were calculated rather than median since data was censored for more than 50% of cases. estimation of the mean is limited to the largest survival time if data were censored. cox regression was then undertaken, using all 594 par- ticipants, to assess the prognostic ability of nt-probnp after allowing for each cohort and other covariates. variables entered into the starting model are as described previously with the addition of atrial ﬁbrilla- tion, ejection fraction and signiﬁcant valve disease. fractional polynomials were considered when compar- ing models of best ﬁt for continuous variables of age, bmi and blood pressure. the proportional hazards assumption was tested using schoenfeld residuals. results nt-probnp levels were measured in 594 participants during the echoes study. an hf diagnosis was con- ﬁrmed for 7 (8%) of those in the general population sample; 36 (35%) of those with a previous label of hf; 15 (17%) of those on diuretics and 9 (7%) of those at high risk. twenty-three (43%) of all those with an hf diagnosis had an ejection fraction of less than 40% and an additional 10 persons (19%) had ejection fraction of between 40% and 49%. the baseline characteristics of all participants in the substudy, broken down by cohort and nt-probnp 150 pg/ml cut-off, are shown in table 1. those in the upper nt-probnp category were older, had more cardio- vascular risk factors and took more medication than those below 150 pg/ml. they also, with exception of those from the cohort with previous label of hf, had more symptoms of hf. the distributions of nt-probnp in each cohort are given in table 2. the general population had the lowest values with more than 75% below 150 pg/ml. highest 2 taylor cj, roalfe ak, iles r, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004675. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004675 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

levels were observed in the cohort with a previous label of hf. figures 1–4 show the receiver operating curves for assessing the performance of nt-probnp in diagnosing hf in each of the cohorts. the auroc for nt-probnp levels above 150 pg/ml was 0.95 (95% ci 0.88 to 1.00) for the general population; 0.83 (0.75 to 0.91) for those with previous label of hf; 0.91 (0.82 to 1.00) for those on diuretics; and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.97) for those at risk of hf. the cut-off for nt-probnp at 150 pg/ml had sensi- tivity of 100% (95% ci 59% to 100%) and speciﬁcity of 79.5% (95% ci 74.5% to 83.9%) in identifying hf in the general population sample; 97.2% (85.5% to 99.9%) sensitivity and 29.9% (19.3% to 42.3%) speciﬁcity for those with previous label of hf; 93.3% (68.1% to 99.8%) sensitivity and 43.8% (32.2% to 55.9%) speciﬁ- city for those on diuretics; and 100% (66.4% to 100%) sensitivity and 53.6% (44.5% to 62.6%) speciﬁcity for those at high risk. a full summary of performance characteristics, including positive and negative predictive values and accuracy is given in table 3. other cut-offs were not considered in this analysis due to the high sen- sitivity and reasonable speciﬁcity observed using the chosen cut-off. overall, a cut-off of 150 pg/ml found 100% of hf cases and 80% of non-hf cases. the per- centage of deaths at 10 years with nt-probnp ≥150 pg/ml at baseline was 50% in the general population, 86% in hf label group, 71% in the high-risk group and 84% in the diuretics group. the multiple logistic regression analysis suggests that nt-probnp≥150 pg/ml is predictive of hf (or=17.7 (95% ci 4.9 to 63.5)) after allowing for cohort related variables (table 4). cause of death cardiovascular disease was the main cause of death in each cohort, ranging from 31% (95% ci 20% to 46%) in the general population to 49% (95% ci 37% to 61%) in the high-risk group. the remaining deaths were mainly due to respiratory disease and cancer. survival analysis of the general population cohort there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in survival between those who had an nt-probnp level ≥150 pg/ ml and those with an nt-probnp level <150 pg/ml in the general population sample (log-rank test, χ2=30.4, 1, p<0.0001) as shown in ﬁgure 5. mean survival for those table 2 distribution of nt-probnp in each cohort cohort n median (iqr) general population 309 70.9 (35.3–130.1) previous label of hf 103 493.6 (204.3–1341) on diuretics 88 200 (76.1–672.8) at high risk 134 160.1 (64.6–386.3) hf, heart failure; nt-probnp, n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide. figure 2 receiver operating characteristic curve to show effectiveness of baseline n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) in predicting a diagnosis of heart failure at screening in the ‘previous label of heart failure’ cohort. figure 1 receiver operating characteristic curve to show effectiveness of baseline n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) in predicting a diagnosis of heart failure at screening in the general population cohort. figure 3 receiver operating characteristic curve to show effectiveness of baseline n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) in predicting a diagnosis of heart failure at screening in the ‘prescribed diuretics’ cohort. 4 taylor cj, roalfe ak, iles r, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004675. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004675 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

89%, respectively in the general population). an nt-probnp level ≥150 pg/ml was strongly predictive of a diagnosis of hf at screening and of death in the next 10 years. strengths and limitations of the study the echoes study represents a unique cohort of patients with well phenotyped hf from a community setting. the rigour of clinical assessment means the diagnosis of hf is accurate. all participants’ notes were ﬂagged by ons to ensure accurate data about date and cause of death, and were sent to the research team. the ons records reﬂect the reason for death in the opinion of the attending clinician, as recorded on the death cer- tiﬁcate, but the symptoms of hf can be similar to other conditions, particularly respiratory disorders and clini- cians can disagree. the study design also did not allow for interim data collection so non-fatal end points, such as hospitalisation, were not explored. nt-probnp levels were not recorded in all participants of the echoes study however the baseline character- istics of the nt-probnp substudy were similar to those of the study population as a whole. only 3% of participants were non-white which may not fully reﬂect the ethnic diversity of the uk population and nt-probnp levels may vary depending on ethnicity. renal function was not recorded in this study therefore we were unable to assess the effect of renal impairment on mortality.13 a cut-off of 150 pg/ml was chosen to represent a raised level of nt-probnp in the substudy however debate exists around the optimal cut-off level for nt-probnp.14 the study reports a long-term follow-up of 10 years and over this time the diagnostic criteria and management of hf have changed signiﬁcantly. the original diagnosis of hf in the echoes study was based on the european society of cardiology guideline 1995 and this deﬁnition has been updated several times since then.15–17 at the time, hf with reduced ejection fraction was the main recognised type of hf and the most common precursor to this was, and remains, ischaemic heart disease. sixty-nine per cent of the hf-labelled group in this study had a history of angina or mi. in the past 10–15 years, hf with preserved ejection fraction, or hf-pef, has also been recognised as a distinct clinical and pathological entity. the atrial ﬁbrillation and/or signiﬁcant valve disease groups (with normal ejection fraction) in the echoes table 4 logistic regression model to predict hf variable or (95% ci*) p value previous label of hf 3.74 (1.45 to 9.69) 0.007 on diuretics 5.26 (1.70 to 16.31) 0.004 diabetes 4.91 (1.66 to 14.51) 0.004 hypertension 0.39 (0.16 to 0.97) 0.04 angina 1.22 (0.99 to 5.00) 0.053 myocardial infarction 1.61 (0.67 to 3.86) 0.29 nt-probnp ≥150 pg/ml 17.65 (4.91 to 63.48) <0.001 *bootstrapped estimates. hf, heart failure; nt-probnp, n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide. figure 6 kaplan-meier curve showing n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) level and ten year survival for the cohort with a previous label of heart failure. figure 5 kaplan-meier curve showing n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) level and ten year survival for the general population cohort. figure 7 kaplan-meier curve showing n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) level and ten year survival for the diuretic cohort. 6 taylor cj, roalfe ak, iles r, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004675. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004675 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


study may have partly captured some patients with hfpef but this group will have largely been excluded. the echoes-extension study has rescreened the entire cohort, phenotyping for hf-ref and hf-pef and will report shortly. comparison with existing literature a study by wang et al8 investigated the relationship between bnp levels and risk of cardiovascular events or death in 3346 patients from the framingham cohort who did not have hf at baseline. in total 119 partici- pants died and 79 had a ﬁrst cardiovascular event during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. for each 1 sd increment increase in log bnp level, risk of developing hf increased by 77% (p<0.001) and risk of death increased by 27% (p=0.009). bnp and nt-probnp levels also increase with hf stage. a study of patients over the age of 45 from the rochester epidemiology study found that mean bnp (rather than nt-probnp) level was 26 pg/ml in patients without hf, 32 pg/ml in those with risk factors, 53 pg/ ml in those asymptomatic participants with structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, 137 pg/ml in partici- pants with hf symptoms and 353 pg/ml for participants with severe hf. survival declined progressively for each additional stage of disease.18 another study by hartmann et al9 investigated the role of baseline nt-probnp in predicting mortality and hos- pitalisation in patients with a diagnosis of hf. nt-probnp levels were recorded in 814 men and 197 women with severe hf deﬁned as breathlessness at rest or on minimal exertion and an ejection fraction of less than 25%. they were followed up for a median time of 159 days (range 1–488 days). a baseline nt-probnp level above compared to below the median level for the cohort was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for hf (relative risk 2.4; 95% ci 1.8 to 3.4; p=0.0001). nt-probnp has also been found to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients with renal disease.10 overall, participants labelled with hf in the echoes cohort had a better prognosis than some other community-based studies.19 20 this may reﬂect a lower overall risk in the studied population, the introduction of medication known to improve survival, such as ace inhibitors or β-blockers, following screening or a referral bias in that patients in the study may have been more likely to be referred for more intensive hf management. a letter was sent to gps of all study participants with advice on management of participants with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of hf. implications for future research and practice in this substudy, participants with a raised nt-probnp level were more likely to have a conﬁrmed diagnosis of hf after screening. natriuretic peptides are already used in clinical practice to determine the likelihood of hf and guide referral for echocardiography however the optimal cut-off level is still unclear.17 21 the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) clinical guideline on the management of chronic hf recom- mends an nt-probnp of 400 pg/ml is used as the threshold to refer for echocardiography in symptomatic patients, whereas the european society of cardiology suggests a threshold level of 125 pg/ml to exclude hf. fuat et al22 showed that a cut-off of 150 pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 92% in a primary care com- munity hf clinic, again in symptomatic patients. our data suggest that the current nice cut-off is too high and that 150 pg/ml is a more reliable threshold for further investigation, especially since our data include asymptomatic as well as symptomatic non-presenting patients. importantly, participants in the nt-probnp substudy with a raised nt-probnp were also more likely to die sooner than participants with a normal nt-probnp level. these data conﬁrm the potential for incident nt-probnp tests to indicate patient prognosis in primary care settings as has been conﬁrmed in hospital figure 8 kaplan-meier curve showing n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) level and 10 year survival for the high risk cohort. table 5 cox regression model of factors associated with mortality (including all study cohorts) variable hr (95% ci*) p value age 1.10 (1.08 to 1.10) <0.001 male sex 2.05 (1.43 to 2.95) <0.001 previous label of hf 1.75 (1.17 to 2.57) 0.007 on diuretics 0.90 (0.62 to 1.32) 0.59 diabetes 1.08 (0.65 to 1.88) 0.78 hypertension 1.37 (0.99 to 1.90) 0.06 angina 1.04 (0.73 to 1.50) 0.82 myocardial infarction 1.18 (0.80 to 1.73) 0.40 shortness of breath 1.64 (1.14 to 2.37) 0.008 nt-probnp ≥150 pg/ml 1.58 (1.09 to 2.30) 0.02 *bootstrapped estimates. hf, heart failure; nt-probnp, n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide. taylor cj, roalfe ak, iles r, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004675. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004675 7 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


settings. assessment of patients to establish the cause of a raised nt-probnp level such as hf or renal disease fol- lowed by optimal management using evidence-based therapies is crucial to reducing mortality in these high- risk patients. finally, these data are the ﬁrst we are aware of that suggest a possible role for natriuretic peptides in popula- tion screening for hf. given the late diagnosis in many patients and the asymptomatic nature in early stages, this may be an important ﬁnding. acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge dr michael davies and dr russell davis for their contribution to the original echoes study from which these 10-year follow-up data are derived. contributors all authors contributed to the manuscript. fdrh was the principal investigator and established the echocardiographic heart of england screening study (echoes) cohort. cjt and fdrh designed this study. cjt and akr undertook statistical analysis. cjt and ri coded the death data. funding the costs for this analysis were partially supported by the nihr school for primary care research. the national health service research and development cardiovascular disease and stroke programme funded the original echocardiographic heart of england screening study. ct is funded by a doctoral research fellowship from the national institute for health research. competing interests the nt-probnp assays for the echoes study were provided free of charge by roche diagnostics, but roche were not party to the study design, nor any aspect of the analysis, nor to the writeup of this paper. fdrh has received similar indirect research support on other investigator-led heart failure research. fdrh has also received occasional fees or expense reimbursement from roche in the past. ethics approval the study received full ethical approval from the local research ethics committee. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. data sharing statement the complete database for the echoes study is stored securely at the university of birmingham and available on request. all authors have access to the data. open access this is an open access article distributed in accordance with the creative commons attribution non commercial (cc by-nc 3.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non- commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial. see: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/ references 1. de lemos ja, mcguire dk, drazner mh. b-type natriuretic peptide in cardiovascular disease. lancet 2003;362:316–22. 2. escobar c, santiago-ruiz jl, manzano l. diagnosis of heart failure in elderly patients: a clinical challenge. eur j heart fail 2011;13:1152. 3. ahmad t, o’connor c. therapeutic implications of biomarkers in chronic heart failure. clin pharmacol ther 2013;94:468–79. 4. mark db, felker gm. b-type natriuretic peptide—a biomarker for all seasons?
