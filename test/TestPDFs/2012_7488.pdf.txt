running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  2 of 27  abstract    background: the benefit of the coronary collateral circulation (natural bypass network) on  survival is well-established. on the other hand, there is data derived from smaller studies  indicating that coronary collaterals may increase the risk for restenosis after percutaneous  coronary interventions. the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of  observational studies was to explore the impact of the collateral circulation on the risk for  restenosis.  methods: we searched medline, embase, isi web of science (2001 to  july 15, 2011).  random-effects models were used to calculate summary risk ratios (rr) for restenosis.   primary endpoint was angiographic restenosis >50%.  results: a total of 7 studies enrolling 1,425 subjects were integrated in this analysis. on  average across studies, the presence of a good collateralization was predictive for restenosis  (risk ratio rr 1.40 [95% confidence interval 1.09 – 1.80]; p= 0.009). this risk ratio was  consistent in the subgroup analyses where collateralization was assessed with intracoronary  pressure measurements (rr 1.37 [1.03 - 1.83]; p=0.038) versus visual assessment (rr 1.41  [1.00 - 1.99]; p=0.049). for the subgroup of patients with stable cad, the rr for restenosis  with “good collaterals” was 1.64 [1.14 -2.35] compared to “poor collaterals”(p=0.008). for  patients with acute myocardial infarction,  however, the rr for restenosis with “good  collateralization” was only 1.23 [0.89 - 1.69]; p= 0.212).   conclusions: the risk of restenosis after pci is increased in patients with good coronary  collateralization. assessment of the coronary collateral circulation before pci may be useful  for risk stratification and for the choice of anti-proliferative measures (drug-eluting stent  instead bare-metal stent, cilostazol).

running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  4 of 27  cardiovascular therapeutics, the american heart association, and the world congress of  cardiology were searched. we also considered published review articles, editorials, and  internet-based sources of information (www.tctmd.com, www.theheart.org,  www.europcronline.com, www.cardiosource.com, and www.crtonline.com) to assess  potential information on studies of interest. reference lists of selected articles were reviewed  for other potentially relevant citations. no language restriction was applied. authors of  selected studies were contacted to obtain further information if needed. all prospective  studies reporting on an association between restenosis probability and coronary collateral  circulation were included in this analysis. retrospective case-control studies were not  considered. we focused on prospective cohort studies because our objective was to define    the value of collaterals as a marker for future restenosis. furthermore, we excluded  retrospective case-control studies because we think that matching of cases with controls could  introduce critical bias; and in many cases, collaterals cannot be assessed accurately in  restrospect.     the detailed search syntax for the database medline is shown in supplementary table 1.  the  syntax for other databases was similar but was adapted were necessary.    study selection  in a 2-step selection process, the titles and abstracts of all citations were reviewed by two  researchers (p.m., c.s.) to identify potentially relevant studies. in a second step, the  corresponding publications were reviewed in full text to assess if studies met the following  inclusion criteria: association of restenosis risk and the degree of coronary collateralization  (figure 1).      


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  5 of 27  data extraction and quality assessment  relevant information from the articles including baseline clinical characteristics of the study  population and outcome measures were extracted using the prepared standardized extraction  database (ms excel). the quality of each study was assessed with the newcastle-ottawa  scale (nos) for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies in meta-analyses.[8] based  on this scale, an additional sensitivity analysis of studies with superior quality was performed  (at least 7 of 8 points). we did not use the quality scores for study weighting due to the  limitations inherent to such an approach.[9]    endpoints  the primary endpoint of this analysis was angiographic binary restenosis (>50% restenosis).  this dichotomized endpoint definition was selected because we expected that most studies  report on dichotomized values; classically, a 50% cut-off has been used in angioplasty studies.  this value was mainly based on experimental work of gould et al., demonstrating blunting of  the hyperemic response at a stenosis degree of 50%.[10]    definitions  good collateralization was defined differently in the individual studies. three studies  performed a visual assessment (rentrop score)[11] and used a score of ≤ 1 for poor  collateralization (no or only faintly visible collaterals).  in brief, the rentrop score assigns  four degrees of collateralization depending on the presence and extension of the collateral  filling of coronary epicardial vessels during a coronary angiogram (grade 0=no collaterals;  grade 1=side branch filling of the recipient artery without filling of the main epicardial artery;  grade 2=partial filling of the main epicardial recipient artery; and grade 3=complete filling of  the main epicardial recipient artery). four studies based their collateral quantification on intra- coronary pressure measurements (collateral flow index, cfi)[12] (table 1) and defined poor

[19]    results  description of included studies   a total of 123 articles were reviewed and 7 studies including 1,425 patients satisfied the  predetermined inclusion criteria (figure 1).[5, 6, 20-24] the study of wahl et al. has been  published as a retrospective case-control study.[25] the study focused on patients with  restenosis (case) and compared them to control patients without restenosis. the data used in  this meta-analysis are based on a re-analysis of the identical cohort but with dividing patients  into a group with “good collateralization” and “poor collateralization”, depending on their  cfi (threshold < versus ≥ 0.25), the incidence of restenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) was  calculated for the two groups (unpublished data). table 1 summarizes the characteristics of  the included studies. all patients had routine angiographic follow up.    restenosis risk   patients with a good collateralization showed a significantly increased risk for restenosis  compared to patients with poor collateralization (rr 1.40 [1.09 – 1.80]; p= 0.009  [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.055; i2 = 52.2% [0% - 79.7%]; p= 0.051]. (figure 2).  


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  8 of 27    investigation of heterogeneity   analyses stratified by the method of collateral assessment showed very consistent results:  good collaterals were associated with an increased restenosis risk. for visually assessed  collateral assessment (based on rentrop scoring) the rr was 1.41 ([1.00 - 1.99]; p=0.049  [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.059; i2 = 64.1%, p= 0.062]) and for cfi-based collateral assessment,  the corresponding rr was 1.37 ([1.03 - 1.83]; p=0.038 [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.112; i2 =  56.1% , p= 0.077]). (figure 3) there was no significant impact of the assessment method on  the risk ratio in the according meta-regression analysis, the ratio of risk ratio between “visual  assessment” and “cfi based assessment”  was 1.02 [0.59 - 1.71], p= 0.953.  the results were also very consistent between the 2 studies using plain balloon angioplasty  (poba) in all patients and those 2 studies using bare metal stents (bms)(table 1). the  proportion of bms used in the individual studies had no significant effect on the result neither  (meta-regression: slope -0.15 [-10.83 – 0.54]; p=0.221; the meta-regression slope describes  the impact of the proportion of bms use on the study effect size; the log rr decreases on  average by -0.15 when all the patients have a bms implanted compared to the situation where  none of the patients receives a bms. (supplementary figure 1) further, no significant effect  of the restenosis risk in the control group (patients with poor collaterals) on the results was  found neither  (metaregression: slope -2.44 [-6.54 – 1.66] p=0.425); this means that the log  rr decreases on average by -2.44 if the restenosis risk in the control group (poor collaterals)  is 100% compared to the situation where the restenosis risk is 0%. (supplementary figure 2)  on the other hand, patients undergoing elective pci for stable cad tended to show a more  pronounced influence of collaterals on the restenosis risk. the risk ratio for those with good  collateralization was 1.64 [1.14 -2.35]; p=0.008 [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.049; i2 = 35.9% , p=  0.197] ). for patients with acute myocardial infarction on the other hand, the respective rr  was 1.23 [0.89 - 1.69]; p= 0.212 [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.049; i2 = 58.3%, p= 0.091]) (figure 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  9 of 27  4). however, the according meta-regression analysis showed no statistically significant effect  of this variable on the rr, the ratio of risk ratio between “elective pci” and “acute mi” was  1.33 [0.82 - 2.16], p=0.243.    sensitivity analyses   none of the studies influenced the results to the extent that the conclusion would have  changed; the jackknife procedure-based sensitivity analysis omitting one study at a time  consistently showed that good collateralization is associated with an increased restenosis risk  (figure 5).  specifically, excluding the only unpublished data included in this analysis (based  on wahl et al.[25] ) did not change the overall rr estimate (rr 1.43 [1.07; 1.91]; p= 0.016  [heterogeneity: tau2 = 0.074; i2 = 60.1% , p= 0.028]).when considering studies with highest  quality only (based on the newcastle-ottawa scale; at least 7 of 8 points), the estimate for rr  for restenosis for the group with good collaterals was very consistent but did not reach  statistical significance (1.47  [0.78 - 2.76]; p= 0.235 [heterogeneity: tau2 <0.001; i2 = 0% , p=  0.866); three studies were considered in this analysis.[5, 6, 24]  the funnel plot was symmetrical (figure 6) and formal testing did not indicate a relevant  “small study effect” or publication bias (egger's test p=0.362, rank correlation test p=0.273).  three studies enrolled patients with acute mi. while the visual assessment of collaterals  should not be altered  and may even be more accurate, because the vessel of interest is  occluded and avoids “competitive” flow via the native and the collateral vessels, the accuracy  of quantitative cfi measurements have been questioned in this setting.[26] when excluding  the one study using cfi measurements in acute mi ,[6] the overall result increases minimally,  from rr 1.40 [1.09 – 1.80] to rr 1.48  [1.12 - 1.94];p= 0.005 [heterogeneity: tau2 =0.061; i2  = 55.5%, p= 0.047]. for the subgroup of acute mi patients, the rr increases from 1.23 [0.89 -  1.69] to rr 1.32  [0.86 - 2.04]; p= 0.204 [heterogeneity: tau2 =0.075; i2 = 75.7% , p= 0.043]. 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  10 of 27  lastly, we also calculated prediction intervals, which are wider compared to confidence  intervals. for the overall results, including all studies, the rr was 1.40 with a prediction  interval of 0.70 - 2.78. for the patients with elective pci, it was 1.64 {0.47 - 5.65}, for those  with acute mi it was 1.23 {0.04 -38.11}.  this means that we predict that the true effect in a new study (assumed to be “similar” to  those studies included in the meta-analysis) would lie between rr = 0.70 and rr = 2.78 with  95% confidence. as such, although the average effect across studies of a 40% increase in  restenosis in patients with a good collateralization is statistically significant, due to  unexplained heterogeneity between existing results we cannot be sure of an effect in a new  study.      discussion    this meta-analysis of 7 studies shows that a “good collateralization” is predictive for  restenosis in patients undergoing pci. this risk was found to be increased by 40% [95% ci 0  - 80%] compared to patients with poor collateralization. this association was found to be  stronger in patients with stable coronary artery disease (risk increased by 64% [14 - 135%])  while it was weaker for patients with acute mi (risk increased by 23% [-11% - 69%]) and did  not reach statistical significance in this subset.  it has to be considered that the differences of  the rr estimates between these  subgroup analyses were not statistically significant.  moreover, all these values are estimates of the average effect across the different studies.     this data indicate that the degree of collateralization may be a useful and simple tool to  inform individual clinical decision making, patients at high risk for restenosis may profit from 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  11 of 27  the more expensive drug-eluting stents and from cilostazol which both reduce the restenosis  risk.[27, 28]    collaterals – good or bad?    good coronary collateralization has been found to be associated with improved survival. [3, 4,  29]  in this regard it may seem contradictory that good collateralization is a risk factor for  restenosis after pci. similarly, accelerated disease progression of the native vessel after  coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) is a frequent phenmomenon which does not affect  the clinical benefit of cabg. [30]    coronary collaterals may be regarded as an analogue to cabg in that both provide an  alternative blood supply to the myocardium. therefore, increased restenosis after pci and  improved survival benefit in patients with good collateralization are not mutually exclusive.  restenosis is usually a slow process and rarely results in a life-threatening event. this is  demonstrated by the fact that most treatments which reduce the risk for restenosis, e.g. drug  eluting stents, do not result in improved survival.    potential mechanisms  one of the possible reasons for the increased risk of restenosis in case of a good  collateralization is the flow via the collaterals which competes with the antegrade blood flow  through the native vessel.[23, 31, 32] as mentioned above, a similar phenomenon is  frequently observed in native coronary arteries in proximity to a bypass graft, which also  represents a collateral circulation, leading to decreased flow through the native vessel.[31, 32]  this reduced flow subsequently results in a decreased shear stress on the endothelial cell  layer. this shear stress is known to be athero-protective. [33] monocytes and platelets are key 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  12 of 27  players in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis; low flow and low shear  stress increase the chance of cell adhesion to the vessel wall.[34] low shear stress also  modulates endothelial cell gene expression into a pro-inflammatory state.[35] on the other  hand, the increased shear stress is suppressing this pro-inflammatory genes, specifically via   the lung kruppel-like factor (lklf), an anti-inflammatory endothelial transcription factor.  [36, 37] lkfl also reduces the expression of the substance monocyte chemoattractant- protein-1 (mcp-1). as its name suggests, mcp-1 attracts monocytes and has a pro- atherogenic effect.[38] however, the exact mechanism of this “mechano-transduction”,  translating physical forces into changes at a molecular level,  is not completely understood.   data suggest that g proteins may act as primary mechano-sensors on endothelial cells, a  further concept that has evolved are mechano-sensitive ion channels that translate the physical  force into a corresponding intracellular signal.[39]    coronary collaterals as a marker or as a causal risk factor for restenosis?  the major determinant of collateral function is the degree of vessel stenosis, which itself  has  been described to increase restenosis risk.[40, 41] [42] the studies included in this meta- analysis did not adjust for co-variates such as vessel diameter stenosis or the extent of cad.  as an alternative explanation, coronary collaterals could simply represent markers for more  severe underlying cad with consecutive increased risk for restenosis after pci. this  interesting question remains to be resolved in future studies. regardless of a causal or a casual  association, the degree of coronary collateralization represents a valuable and simple marker  to predict the risk for restenosis.     outlook  future research should evaluate possible mechanisms of this increased restenosis risk in  patients with good collateralization. this patient group may show different  levels of cytokine 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  13 of 27  activation, inflammation, levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) or platelet activation after  ptca which may be addressed by additional pharmacologic approaches. as one hypothesis  to be tested, oxygen level distal to the vessel occlusion during angioplasty varies with varying  collateralization and may lead to different ros levels. higher ros levels may damage  endothelial cells down-stream and thereby increase the risk for restenosis.     limitations of this meta-analysis  most studies used exclusively binary data for their analysis. the extent of variable of interest,  collateralization, was dichotomized into “good” and “poor collateralization” while in fact, the  degree of collateralization is a continuous variable. besides this variable of interest, also the  outcome was dichotomized in most studies, using a restenosis threshold of 50%. one draw- back of this approach is the impaired statistical power. still, this meta-analysis was large  enough to detect a significant influence of collaterals on restenosis risk. a related problem is  the fact that all patients underwent routine angiographic follow up. some of the patients may  have had a stable instent-restenosis without symptoms, the routine angiographic follow up  may overrate the clinical importance of restenosis and it may overestimate the impact of  collaterals on restenosis .[43]  further, the included studies did not adjust for potential confounding factors such as the  severity of cad, the diameter stenosis, etc. since this is a study-level and not a patient-level   meta-analysis, we were not able to include these factors in the analyses. however, we think  that significant confounding regarding our primary outcomes is rather unlikely. the main  determinant of collaterals (our predictor) is the degree of the vessel diameter stenosis, the  narrower the stenosis, the better the collaterals. [40] however, the degree of stenosis is not  known to be a risk factor for future re-stenosis (primary outcome of ours study).  


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  14 of 27  moreover, this study does not capture the dynamic of the coronary collaterals. the coronary  collateral function has been demonstrated to decrease over a 6-month  period after pci. [44]  this dynamic may explain the non-significant results in the setting of acute mi. during an  acute vessel occlusion, the collaterals undergo rapid changes; a fact, that limits the value of a  single time-point measurement. further, the increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure  during an acute mi impairs the accuracy of the collateral assessment.[26]  another important limitation is the heterogeneity among the studies included in this analysis.  the extent of heterogeneity reduces the robustness of our results  we have therefore  performed several subset analyses and meta-regression analysis; we found several aspects that  contribute to this heterogeneity. the most important one is the difference in study  populations. four studies included patients with stable cad while 3 studies focused on  patients with acute mi (table 1). further, the earliest 2 studies used plain balloon angioplasty  while the newest studies used bare metal stents in all patients.[5, 24] also, 4 studies used cfi  based collateral assessment while 3 studies used visual assessment of collaterals. despite this  heterogeneity between studies, the findings were very consistent in most of the subset and  sensitivity analyses. moreover, the accuracy of cfi measurements in the setting of an acute  mi has been questioned. [26]  however, this only applies to one study[6] and excluding this  study did influence the overall results only minimally (see ‘sensitivity analyses’).    a further drawback of this study is that early studies used plain balloon angioplasty and later  studies used bms. no des were used in the present studies. whether the results of this meta- analysis can be generalized to drug-eluting stents (des) remains unanswered. des have  further reduced the risk for restenosis, it is highest for poba (32% in average), around 22%  for bms and around 16% for first-generation des.[45, 46] the predictive value of collaterals  may be reduced in the context of des. however, even with des, restenosis is still a  significant and unresolved  problem. our findings were consistent in the poba and in the 


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  15 of 27  bms group, they were not significantly influenced by the proportion of bms use in the  individual studies nor by the average restenosis risk in the control groups (poor collaterals).  we would therefore expect similar results for drug-eluting stents.   another limitation of our study is that it does not provide further insights into possible causal  mechanisms of our finding. our considerations in the discussion are rather hypothetical. this  study, overall, is rather hypothesis generating than confirmatory.   with regard to the meta-regression analyses, it has to be considered that they have limited  statistical power and a lack of statistical significance does not necessarily mean that there is  no true effect.   


running title: collaterals and restenosis   meier p et al.  16 of 27    conclusion  the results of this meta-analysis including 1,425 patients show that a good coronary  collateralization indicates an increased risk for restenosis. the degree of coronary  collateralization may be a useful information for clinical decision making during pci, such as  stent choice (des versus bms), use of cilostazol and it may also impact the aggressiveness  of the post-pci management.     disclosures  bp received consultant fees from pfizer, novartis, merck, takeda, boehringer-ingelheim,  bayer, forrest laboratories, ge health care, relypsa, nile therapeutics, aurasense and has  stock options of relypsa, nile therapeutics, aurasense.  bp received research grants from  medtronic, novartis and bayer. the other authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.     authors' contributions  pm was responsible for the conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and  interpretation of data, drafting the initial manuscript and revising it critically for important  intellectual content.  ai was responsible for acquisition of data, data control, interpretation of  data  and for revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content. tt, sfd,tk,  ajl were responsible for revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content.  gk was responsible for analysis and interpretation of data and for revising the manuscript  critically for important intellectual content .cs was responsible for the conception and design,  acquisition of data, interpretation of data, and for revising the manuscript critically for  important intellectual content. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.
