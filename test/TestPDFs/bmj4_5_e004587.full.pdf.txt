ulcerogenic by a majority of physicians and that a major- ity of practitioners would treat corticosteroid users with ulcer prophylaxis.14 this uncertainty may have conse- quences for clinical recommendations and treatment guidelines, and is the main reason why we performed this systematic review.15–18 gi bleeding, bleeding peptic ulcer and perforation are feared complications of peptic ulcer disease, asso- ciated with considerable morbidity and mortality.19 20 non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaid) use and helicobacter pylori infection are the most important risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. bleeding or perforation is also seen as complications to stress ulcers among patients with critical illness in intensive care units. gi bleeding and perforation are assumed to occur when ulcers erode into underlying vessels. the mechanism by which corticosteroids might induce gi bleeding or per- foration has not been fully established, but corticoster- oids may impair tissue repair, thus leading to delayed wound healing.8 in addition, the anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic properties of corticosteroids may mask symp- toms of gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications and thus possibly delay diagnosis. the aim of this systematic review was to examine whether use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcer complications such as gi bleeding or perforation. since observational studies have not been conclusive, we have chosen to include pub- lished studies with a randomised, controlled design. methods search strategy and selection criteria a systematic literature search was performed to identify randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in which any systemic corticosteroid (deﬁned as oral, intra- venous or intramuscular) or a placebo had been admini- strated to randomly selected groups of patients in the treatment of a medical disorder or to healthy participants. we searched the databases medline and embase with no language restrictions between 1983 (since date of the latest review by conn and poynard)1 and 30 june 2011 using the following text words: (β methasone/ or dexamethasone/ or methylprednisolone/ or prednisol- one/ or prednisone/ or triamcinolone/ or cortisone/ or hydrocortisone/). the search was limited to rando- mised controlled trials, humans, double blind.mp and placebo.mp. an updated search was performed on 22 may 2013. for the full search strategy, see online supple- mentary ﬁle 1. an additional search was performed in the cochrane database of systematic reviews for corti- costeroids and the following text words: traumatic injury, sepsis/septic shock, meningitis, bronchopulmonary dys- plasia, liver diseases, lung diseases and rheumatoid arth- ritis. only results fully reported in journal articles in english, german or any scandinavian language were considered for inclusion. whenever a title or abstract suggested that a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial comparing a corticosteroid to placebo had been performed, the full text version was reviewed for documentation of gi adverse events. articles with documentation of gi adverse effects or with assessment of adverse event monitoring described in the methods section were included. titles, abstracts and full-text arti- cles were evaluated and reviewed for inclusion by at least two of the authors. disagreements were resolved by con- sensus among the authors. methodological quality assessment of eligible trials was carried out by including only randomised, double-blind studies.21 in most studies, there was no speciﬁc descrip- tion of randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding methods or handling of withdrawals. authors’ description of randomisation and double blinding was assumed to be valid. we used intention-to-treat data when available. all types of comedications were allowed if admi- nistered systematically to both groups or as a part of stand- ard care. no medical disorder or age groups were excluded. when medications known to induce gi symp- toms, such as nsaids or acetylsalicylic acid (asa), had been used, they were analysed as covariables. we excluded trials with a crossover design because of potential difﬁcul- ties in assessment between the treatment groups. trials in which the steroid was given as a single dose were also excluded due to the generally short follow-up. data extraction and outcomes reporting for the diagnosis of complications of gastroduodenal ulcers, such as occult or visible blood in stool, gi bleeding, haematemesis, melena and gi perforation, the investiga- tors’ diagnoses were accepted as valid without requiring speciﬁc criteria or methods. outcomes like dyspepsia, gas- tritis, duodenitis and epigastric pain were not included, and nor was necrotising enterocolitis. for assessment of gi bleeding or perforation as an adverse effect, the number of events should be reported in the results section as text or in a table. events reported as percentages only were cal- culated into numbers by us. in some trials, other adverse effects were reported in the results section but no gi bleeding was listed. these studies were included only if adverse event monitoring was described in the methods section or if it was judged reasonable to expect from the adverse event monitoring system that any gi adverse effects would have been recorded. we recorded information on study characteristics and demographics such as publication year, corticosteroid use, indication for treatment, use of concomitant medi- cations, description of adverse effects, study size, dur- ation of treatment and follow-up. severity of disease was assessed by assuming that patients needing hospitalisa- tion were sicker than patients in ambulatory care. information regarding exclusion from study by ongoing, recent or a history of peptic ulcer disease was also recorded. risk of bias was assessed by recording which methods were used for monitoring, deﬁnition and description of adverse effects, randomisation and selec- tion criteria. 2 narum s, westergren t, klemp m. bmj open 2014;4:e004587.

statistical analysis the relative frequencies of the adverse effects were com- pared in the placebo and the corticosteroid group(s) using conventional statistics and meta-analysis. subgroup analyses were performed for different predeﬁned variables, such as for concomitant nsaid use, for use of gastroprotective drugs (proton pump inhibitors, h2 blockers or antacids) and for disease severity. all meta-analytic calculations were made with revman (v.5.2) using the mantel-haenszel method with the random effects model. for other statistics, spss (v.20) was used. for binary outcomes, we calculated ors and 95% cis. all analyses were two tailed, with an α of 0.05. results literature search and study selection the search process identiﬁed 3483 records from data- base searches and 15 studies were retrieved by hand searching. a total of 159 articles ﬁtted our inclusion cri- teria and were included in the review. further details regarding study inclusion and exclusion are shown in ﬁgure 1. we performed an updated search on 22 may 2013 and retrieved three additional studies reporting conﬁrmed gi bleeding events. the new studies did not change the results. characteristics of included studies in this systematic review, 159 studies were included. the main medical conditions were severe infections, lung diseases, traumatic injuries and prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. further details regarding the disease groups are shown in table 1. the corticosteroids used were dexamethasone (55), prednisolone (30), methylprednisolone (29), prednis- one (22), hydrocortisone (16) and other steroids or combinations (7). the sample size ranged from 15 to 10 008 people, with a median sample size of 86. the median duration of treatment was 8.5 days (range 1– 1095 days), and the median follow-up period was 56 days (range 1–1155 days). there was a trend towards shorter duration of treatment and follow-up during hospital treatment (6 and 33 days) compared with ambulant treatment (14 and 58 days; p=0.061 and 0.057, respect- ively). the adverse effects were described as any form of bleeding in 59 studies (upper/lower, minor, haematem- esis, melena, visible/occult blood in stool), perforation in seven studies (perforated gastric ulcer, ileum perfor- ation) and bleeding and perforation in six studies. the deﬁnition of gi bleeding varied between the studies, from bleeding requiring transfusion to occult blood in stool. altogether, 72 (45.3%) studies reported gi bleeding or perforation as an adverse effect (67 hospitalised, 5 ambulant). in the 87 studies without reporting of any gi bleeding or perforation, peptic ulcer was described in only four studies. use of concomitant medication was described in 135 studies (84.9%). in addition, use of concomitant medi- cation was likely in many of the remaining 24 studies, as a consequence of diagnoses such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and traumatic injury to the head or spine. use of medication figure 1 flowchart for the selection of eligible studies. narum s, westergren t, klemp m. bmj open 2014;4:e004587. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004587 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

for any pre-existing diseases was sparsely described. concomitant use of nsaids/asa was described in 19 studies (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, rheumatoid arth- ritis, miscellaneous and sepsis in 9 studies, 5 studies, 4 studies and 1 study, respectively), and use of gastropro- tective drugs was described in 14 studies. in addition, use of concomitant drugs ‘according to standard clinical practice’, etc, which may potentially include use of gas- troprotective drugs, was described in 12 studies. peptic ulcer, ongoing, recent or previous, was an exclusion criterion in 53 (33.3%) of the studies. in the majority of studies (85, 53.5%), the authors reported no effect of corticosteroids on the primary efﬁcacy end- point. study-speciﬁc characteristics are shown in table 2 and in online supplementary ﬁle 2. risk of gi bleeding or perforation the analysis included 33 253 participants (16 773 received corticosteroids and 16 480 received placebo). of those, 804 patients (480 receiving a corticosteroid and 324 receiving a placebo) were reported to have a gi bleeding or perforation, which comprises 2.4% of the study participants (2.9% and 2% for corticosteroids and placebo, respectively). overall, meta-analysis of all the included studies showed a 40% increased or of experi- encing gi bleeding or perforation among corticosteroid users compared with placebo users (or 1.43, 95% ci 1.22 to 1.66; ﬁgure 2, and see online supplementary ﬁle 3). subgroup analysis for each disease group showed a trend towards an increased risk of gi bleeding or perfor- ation in seven out of eight subgroups, but the result was statistically signiﬁcant only for premature infants in pre- vention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1.83, 1.37 to 2.43). sensitivity analyses data from subgroup analyses are shown in table 3. subgroup analysis of studies with hospitalised patients showed an increased risk of developing gi bleeding or perforation (or 1.42, 95% ci 1.22 to 1.66). there was also a trend towards increased risk for patients in ambu- latory care (1.63, 0.42 to 6.34), but this result was not sig- niﬁcant. when the studies with documentation of concomitant nsaid use were excluded, a signiﬁcant dif- ference between corticosteroid and placebo with respect to gi bleeding or perforation was still present (1.44, 1.20 to 1.71). when all studies of premature infants in prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were excluded from the analysis (assuming nsaids were given in all studies), the results were lower but still sig- niﬁcant (1.29, 1.07 to 1.55). when studies with peptic ulcer as an exclusion criterion and studies with concomi- tant use of gastroprotective drugs were subsequently excluded from the analyses, there was little change in the risk of bleeding or perforation in the remaining studies (table 3). the majority of the adverse effects occurred in hospitalised patients. only 11 gi bleedings or perforations occurred among 8651 patients in table 2 study-specific characteristics summary of study characteristics studies total studies with bleeding studies without bleeding p values studies included (%) 159 72 (45.3) 87 (54.7) year of publication, median 1998 1999 0.109 description of adverse effect (%) bleeding 59 (81.9) 0 perforation 7 (9.7) 0 bleeding and perforation 6 (8.3) 0 peptic ulcer only 4 level of care (%) hospitalised 103 67 (93.1) 36 (41.4) <0.001 ambulant 56 5 (6.9) 51 (58.6) use of concomitant medication (%) no concomitant medication described 24 11 (15.3) 13 (14.9) concomitant medication described 135 61 (84.7) 74 (85.1) nsaids/asa 19 11 (15.3) 8 (9.2) 0.326 gastroprotective drugs 14 12 2 0.002 exclusion criteria (%) recent/ongoing peptic ulcer 36 14 (19.4) 22 (25.3) 0.237 previous/history of peptic ulcer 17 6 (8.3) 11 (12.6) study size, number of participants median (iqr) 86 (49.0–181.0) 100 (60.3–246.5) 70 (40.0–128.0) 0.104 duration of treatment, days median (iqr) 8.5 (3.3–28.0) 6.0 (3.0–12.0) 14 (4.0–45.0) 0.061 duration of follow-up, days median (iqr) 56 (21.0–243.8) 33 (21.0–180.0) 58 (19.5–286.5) 0.057 asa, acetylsalicylic acid; nsaids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; ppis, proton pump inhibitors. narum s, westergren t, klemp m. bmj open 2014;4:e004587. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004587 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


ambulatory care (0.13%), compared with 793 gi bleeds or perforations among 24 602 hospitalised patients (3.22%; p<0.001; table 1). the absolute risk of experien- cing gi bleeding, events per 1000 patients, was 1.8 for ambulant patients given steroids, compared with 0.7 for ambulant patients given placebo (table 3). in contrast, hospitalised patients had a much higher risk, 37.9/1000 for steroids and 26.4/1000 for placebo. discussion the overall ﬁndings of this systematic review show that the use of corticosteroids may increase the or by 40% for gi bleeding or perforation. the increased risk, however, was limited to hospitalised patients. for patients in ambulatory care, who had a very low absolute occurrence of gi bleeding or perforation, the increased risk was not statistically signiﬁcant. the results persisted when high-risk/low-risk patients (concomitant nsaid use, previous peptic ulcer as an exclusion criterion and use of gastroprotective drugs) were excluded, indicating the robustness of the results. comparison with other studies previously published meta-analyses addressing whether corticosteroid use predisposes people to gi bleeding or perforation have shown conﬂicting results.1–3 in two figure 2 summary of pooled results. gastrointestinal bleeding in corticosteroid users versus placebo users. the mantel-haenszel (m-h) method with a random effects model was used. table 3 summary of subgroup analyses number of studies number of patients or (95% ci) events steroids/ placebo events per 1000 patients steroids/ placebo hospitalised 103 24 602 1.42 (1.22 to 1.66) 472/321 37.9/26.4 ambulant 56 8651 1.63 (0.42 to 6.34) 8 / 3 1.8/0.7 nsaid use not documented 140 30 874 1.44 (1.20 to 1.71) 372/248 23.9/16.2 nsaid use documented 19 2379 1.30 (0.81 to 2.07) 108/76 90.2/64.4 peptic ulcer as an exclusion criterion not documented 106 25 760 1.47 (1.21 to 1.78) 421/284 32.5/22.1 peptic ulcer as an exclusion criterion documented 53 7493 1.26 (0.81 to 1.96) 59/40 15.4/10.9 gastroprotective drugs not documented 145 31 759 1.42 (1.21 to 1.67) 442/299 27.6/19.0 gastroprotective drugs documented 14 1494 1.29 (0.62 to 2.69) 38/25 50.6/33.6 bronchopulmonary dysplasia excluded 138 30 258 1.29 (1.07 to 1.55) 325/239 21.3/15.9 nsaid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. 6 narum s, westergren t, klemp m. bmj open 2014;4:e004587. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004587 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


meta-analyses, conn and colleagues1 2 concluded that there was no increased risk of peptic ulcer, gi bleeding or perforation by corticosteroid use. in contrast, messer et al3 found an increased incidence of peptic ulcer and gi bleeding. in a subgroup analysis by conn and blitzer,2 however, there was a signiﬁcantly higher rate of gi bleeding from an unknown site among corticosteroid users compared with controls. in his second paper, steroid users had more gi adverse effects (ulcers, symp- toms of ulcers, bleeding, erosions and perforation) than controls, but because of subgroup analyses only and no pooling of results, no differences emerged as statistically signiﬁcant.1 these meta-analyses of randomised con- trolled trials, which included published literature up to 1983, show how different inclusion criteria, selection cri- teria, data handling and interpretation of results may give totally different results and conclusions. newer cochrane meta-analyses have addressed the question in selective patient populations (meningitis, traumatic brain injury and preterm infants). these analyses show a trend22–24 or a statistically signiﬁcant increase25 in the risk ratio of experiencing gi bleeding, with the included studies and results being similar to the subgroups in our study. in our study, we included the literature published from 1983 until now. with 33 253 participants from double-blind, randomised, controlled trials, this is the largest meta-analysis analysing whether corticosteroids increase the risk of gi bleeding. owing to the large size of our study, ﬁndings that were seen as trends in other reviews or went unnoticed because of many subgroup analyses have emerged as a signiﬁcant increase in risk, despite the non-signiﬁcant increase in occurrence in all subgroups except prevention of bronchopulmonary dys- plasia in premature infants. surprisingly, peptic ulcers were hardly listed as an adverse effect in the included studies, in contrast to the studies in the previous reviews by conn and messer. one explanation may be the differ- ences in disease panorama and the discovery and treat- ment of h. pylori. the true occurrence of peptic ulcer may also have been underestimated in the studies because of the heavy medication and intensive care treatment. strengths and limitations of this review in many reviews, the use of narrow inclusion criteria and wide exclusion criteria makes the population homo- geneous, but with rare events there is a high risk of insig- niﬁcant results. in our analysis, inclusion of all studies with a relevant design, including those with concomitant medications and studies with zero events, may reﬂect more realistic treatment conditions and may contribute to the validity of the ﬁndings. owing to the large size of included studies in our review, we were able to perform predeﬁned subgroup analyses assessing the severity of disease (ie, assessed as hospitalised or as ambulant treat- ment), use of nsaids or gastroprotective drugs and documentation of peptic ulcer as exclusion criteria. to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review to indicate that disease severity might inﬂuence the risk of gi bleeding or perforation in corticosteroid users. the main limitations of this review are the possible loss of relevant studies due to the selected search strat- egy, the quality of the included trials and the heterogen- eity of the included patient populations. however, we believe the ﬁndings to be robust, despite this, due to the large number of included studies and participants. randomised controlled trials are designed to show the effect of treatment, not to detect adverse effects, which in many studies were sparsely reported or not reported at all. however, since we included only double-blind studies with placebo control, we suspect similar under- reporting in both study groups. to minimise the risk of bias according to adverse effect detection and reporting, we recorded the methods used for monitoring adverse effects and how the adverse effect was deﬁned in the primary studies. we found diversity in the deﬁnitions of gi bleeding (ie, from occult blood in stool to gi bleed- ing requiring transfusion or hospital stay). in addition, differences in the methods used for monitoring adverse effects may explain the risk differences found in the sen- sitivity analyses. a more rigorous follow-up of patients in intensive care units may thus explain some of the risk differences found between hospitalised patients and patients in ambulatory care. this makes comparisons of absolute risk differences between different disease groups difﬁcult. we aimed to include all disease groups, but still some groups may be under-represented (ie, rheumatoid arth- ritis, organ transplanted patients) since corticosteroid use is standard treatment and is no longer compared with placebo in randomised controlled trials. patients included in randomised controlled trials may differ from patients excluded from trial participation, and may be healthier, without previous peptic ulcer. this may underestimate the true effect of corticosteroids on gi bleeding and perforation within the population. in the majority of the included studies, the use of concomitant medications was described. concomitant medication was related to the study indication (eg, treatment of trauma, meningitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc), in contrast to medications for coexisting diseases, which were hardly mentioned. concomitant use of gastropro- tective drugs and descriptions of supportive care accord- ing to standard clinical practice, which may include the use of gastroprotective drugs, was declared only in a minority of the studies. in addition, the potential under- reporting and undisclosed use of gastroprotective drugs may have underestimated the true risk of having gi bleeding with steroid use. undisclosed use of gastropro- tective drugs may especially apply to ambulant treated patients with dyspepsia. owing to the short-term treat- ment and inclusion of only double-blind studies, we assume that the effect of the possible under-reporting and undisclosed use of gastroprotective drugs was not narum s, westergren t, klemp m. bmj open 2014;4:e004587. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004587 7 open access group.bmj.com

substantial. despite the heterogeneity of the included studies and a potential of under-reporting of adverse effects, there is a consistency across the analyses of an increased frequency of gi bleeding and perforation among patients given steroids compared with patients given placebo. this indicates the robustness of the analysis. clinical implications of this review our analysis shows that the increased risk of gi bleeding or perforation applied to hospitalised patients only, indi- cating that additional factors to corticosteroid therapy, such as disease severity or advanced medical treatment, may make some patients more vulnerable to adverse events to corticosteroid use. one possible explanation is that the bleedings and perforations seen among hospita- lised patients may be complications to the stress ulcers seen in critically ill patients. owing to diagnoses or illnesses like traumatic injury, meningitis and sepsis, we suspected a substantial portion of the hospitalised patients to have been critically ill. to scrutinise this further, we aimed to do separate analyses of critically ill patients or treatment in intensive care units, but lack of descriptions of critical illness or treat- ment in intensive care units in the included studies made us use hospitalisation and ambulant treatment as surrogate markers for disease severity. stress ulcers occur in response to severe physiological stress in critically ill patients. although the mechanism is not completely understood, it involves decreased mucosal blood ﬂow and subsequent tissue ischaemia, resulting in breakdown of mucosal defences, allowing physiological factors to produce injury and ulceration.26 many risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding have been proposed,26 27 but only mechanical ventilation and coa- gulopathy have been documented as independent risk factors. despite this evidence, several studies have shown that acid-suppressive therapy is used as stress ulcer prophylaxis in hospital wards and outpatient settings.15–17 this has been described as an inappropriate use of acid- suppressive therapy. an explanation to this overuse may be the discrepancy between product monographs and databases/clinical recommendations in assessment of peptic ulcer disease and gi bleeding as possible adverse effects to corticosteroids.8 11–13 our analysis also showed increased risk of gi bleeding or perforation among patients in ambulatory care, but the result was not signiﬁcant due to a very low occur- rence of gi bleeding and perforation. according to our results, the data are insufﬁcient to conclude whether corticosteroids are associated with gi bleeding or perfor- ation among patients in ambulatory care. it seems rea- sonable to conclude that the absolute risk of gi bleeding is very low in the ambulatory setting. author affiliations 1center for psychopharmacology, diakonhjemmet hospital, oslo, norway 2department of pharmacology, oslo university hospital, oslo, norway 3department of pharmacology, regional medicines information & pharmacovigilance centre (relis), oslo university hospital, oslo, norway 4norwegian knowledge centre for the health services, oslo, norway 5department of pharmacology, university of oslo, oslo, norway contributors sn, tw and mk conceived the study, performed the systematic review and data extraction, analysed the data and drafted the manuscript. all authors had full access to the data and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and accuracy of the analysis. sn is the guarantor. funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. competing interests none. provenance and peer review not commissioned;
