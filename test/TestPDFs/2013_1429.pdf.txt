benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   2    abstract    background:  chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (ccsvi) has been reported in multiple sclerosis  (ms) yet its significance in relation to cognitive function is undetermined.   objectives:  this study measured the association between presence and severity of ccsvi and cognitive  impairment in patients with ms.  methods:  ccsvi was assessed using extra-cranial and trans-cranial doppler sonography in 109 ms  patients (79 were with relapsing-remitting, 23 with secondary-progressive and 7 with primary- progressive disease subtype).  a subject was considered ccsvi-positive if ≥2 venous hemodynamic  criteria were fulfilled.  the minimal assessment of cognitive function in ms (macfims) battery was  administered assessing the full spectrum of cognitive domains known to be affected by ms.  depression  was quantified using the beck depression inventory fast screen (bdifs).  partial correlations, analysis of  variance (or covariance) and linear regression were used to examine the hypothesis that ccsvi status is  related to cognition or depression, after controlling for education and gender.    results:  there were 64 (58.7%) patients considered ccsvi-positive.  the regression models predicting  vhiss score were not statistically significant for any of the macfims predictor variables.  the ancovas  showed a significant effect of ccsvi-positive diagnosis on cognitive ability in only one of the 10  macfims outcomes, and that one was in the opposite direction of the tested hypothesis.  there was no  correspondence between ccsvi diagnosis and depression, as measured by the bdifs.  conclusions:  we find no evidence of an association between presence and severity of ccsvi with  cognitive impairment and depression in patients with ms. 


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   3    introduction  multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, causing both  demyelination and neurodegeneration [1, 2].  as would be expected, a substantial number, roughly 50%  [3-5], of ms patients have cognitive impairment.  in recently diagnosed or benign course patients, the  incidence ranges from 20-40% [5, 6] whereas in samples with substantial secondary progressive course,  roughly 60% of patients are affected [4].  the correlation between cognitive impairment and brain  atrophy is robust [7-9].  however, why some patients evidence cognitive impairment and brain atrophy  while others do not, is poorly understood.     chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (ccsvi) was first reported in ms patients in 2009  [10].  as a vascular condition, ccsvi is characterized by anomalies of the main extra-cranial  cerebrospinal venous routes, mainly in internal jugular and azygous veins that are hypothesized  interfere with normal venous outflow from the brain to the periphery.  since then, the topic has met  with unprecedented controversy following a wide range of reported ccsvi frequencies in ms studies  [11-13].  diagnosis of ccsvi implies a pathological condition the determination of which is based mainly  on color doppler sonography (ds) of extra (neck) and intra-cranial veins using five venous hemodynamic  (vh) criteria (with cutoff of ≥2 positive criteria used for a diagnosis of ccsvi) [10, 14].  so far, published  studies comparing prevalence of ccsvi in ms patients and controls [12, 15] have not reproduced the  original zamboni findings showing 100% sensitivity/specificity [10, 14].  while some groups did report  higher prevalence in ms patients than controls [16, 17], others reported the opposite, that is, no greater  frequency in ms than healthy persons [16, 18-22].  in the largest cohort studied to date, we found a  ccsvi frequency of 56.1% in ms compared to 22.7% in healthy controls [23], however the condition was  detected also in high frequency in patients with other neurologic diseases.  while not causative, some studies suggest that ccsvi may be a risk factor for clinical worsening  in ms [24-26], although here too there are contradictory results [16, 20]. in a large cohort study 


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   4    exploring the association between ccsvi status and both lesion burden and brain atrophy in ms, no  relationship was found [27].  if ccsvi is a risk factor for neurodegeneration or progressive neurologic disability, we would  expect significant correlation between ccsvi and cognitive impairment within ms cohorts.  the present  study was intended to examine this hypothesis.         methods    participants.  the neuropsychological data were collected in a single-center, cross-sectional rater- blinded study that included patients with definite ms who were undergoing determination of ccsvi  status.  exclusion criteria were as follows: [a] presence of relapse or steroid treatment in the 30 days  preceding study entry, [b] pre-existing medical conditions known to be associated with brain pathology,  [c] pre-existing neuropsychiatric conditions known to be associated with cognitive impairment,  including, for eg, learning disability, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury,  among others, [d] history of cerebral congenital vascular malformations, [e] current alcohol or drug  abuse, [f] pregnancy.  participants underwent a clinical and neuropsychological examination, as well as  both trans- and extra-cranial doppler sonography.  demographic and clinical information on all  participating subjects were acquired via a structured questionnaire and by examination.  the collected  data included age, sex, age at disease onset, age at diagnosis, symptoms at disease onset and diagnosis,  disease duration, expanded disability status scale (edss) [28], disease subtype [29] and physical  examination.    the study institutional review board approved, and informed consent was obtained from all  patients.     


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   5    neuropsychological assessment.  the neuropsychological examination was performed by trained  personnel who were blinded to the subjects’ clinical and ccsvi characteristics.  while patients with  current major depressive episode were excluded from the study, remitted or minor depression was  permitted, and the degree was quantified using the beck depression inventory fast screen (bdifs) [30]  which has been validated in ms [31].    next, the minimal assessment of cognitive function in ms (macfims) battery was administered  [32] assessing the full spectrum of cognitive domains known to be affected by ms.  the macfims has  been tested using large prospective ms samples [33, 34] and its psychometric properties have been  established through the development of the individual tests and further research on the overall battery  [35].  also, the tests on the macfims correlate well with brain mri metrics in ms samples [36, 37].  the  specific tests included are as follows: the oral response only version of the symbol digit modalities test  (sdmt) [38], the paced auditory serial addition test pasat [39], california verbal learning test, 2 nd   edition (cvlt2) [40], brief visual memory test, revised (bvmtr) [41], controlled oral word association  test (cowat) [42], judgment of line orientation test (jlo) [43], and the delis-kaplan executive  function system-sorting test (dkefs) [44].  the tests were normalized on the basis of recently published  normative data that accounts for demographics such as age and education [33].    doppler sonography (ds).  extra- and trans-cranial ds was performed on a color-coded ds scanner  (mylab 25; esaote-biosound, irvine, california) equipped with a 5.0- to 10-mhz transducer to examine  venous return in the ijvs and vvs. the ds examination was performed by two trained technologists who  were blinded to the subjects’ demographic, clinical and neuropsychological characteristics. the detailed  scanning protocol and validation were previously reported [23].  briefly, the following 5 vh parameters  indicative of ccsvi were investigated: 1) reflux/bidirectional flow in the internal jugular and/or in the  vertebral veins (ijv; vv) in sitting and in supine positions, defined as flow directed towards the brain for 


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   6    a duration of >0.88 s; 2) reflux/bidirectional flow in the deep cerebral veins defined as reverse flow for a  duration of 0.5 s in one of the intra-cranial veins; 3) b-mode abnormalities or stenoses in ijvs.  ijv  stenosis is defined as a cross-sectional area (csa) of this vein ≤0.3 cm 2 ; 4) flow that is not doppler- detectable in ijvs and/or vvs despite multiple deep breaths, and 5) reverted postural control of the  main cerebral venous outflow pathway by measuring the difference of the csa of the ijvs in the supine  and upright positions.  a subject was considered ccsvi-positive if ≥2 vh criteria were fulfilled, as  previously proposed [10].    we calculated the venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score (vhiss) [14, 45], defined as  a weighted sum of the scores contributed by each individual vh criterion.  the formula for the vhiss  calculations is: vhiss =vhiss1 + vhiss2 + vhiss3 + vhiss4 + vhiss5.  the vhiss score is an ordinal  measure of the overall extent and number of vh flow pattern anomalies, with a higher value of vhiss  indicating a greater severity of abnormal flow.  the minimum possible vhiss value is 0 and the  maximum 16.    statistical analyses:  statistical analyses were performed using spss software.  as noted above, for  descriptive purposes, the raw test scores derived from neuropsychological examination were  normalized using previously published data [33].  partial correlations were performed using the pearson  product-moment correlation coefficient, and the ccsvi positive and negative groups were compared  using analysis of variance (or covariance) and chi-square tests.  linear regression was used to examine  the hypothesis that ccsvi status as measured by the vhiss score is related to cognitive function or  depression, after controlling for education and gender.   throughout, we employed a conservative  threshold of p < 0.01 to control for type 1 error.   


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   7    results     of the 109 patients enrolled, 79 were diagnosed with relapsing-remitting, 23 with secondary- progressive, and 7 with primary-progressive disease subtype.  all were caucasian, except two african- americans and two of latin american heritage.  the other descriptive statistics including demographic,  clinical, depression and cognitive outcomes are presented in table 1.  the ccsvi positive and negative  ms groups were well matched, and no age, disease duration, edss or disease subtype differences were  found. while the pattern of cognitive impairment was the same as described in previous studies (sdmt  and bvmtr most sensitive), overall we found less impairment in this sample as compared to some  previous studies using the same test battery [7, 46-48].        there were 64 (58.7%) patients considered ccsvi-positive and 45 negative (table 1).  as shown  in figure 1, the total criteria vhiss score ranged 0 to 8.  the median was represented by 26 patients  achieving a score of 3.     there were modest trends toward linear correlation between education (r = 0.25) and gender (r  = -0.15) and the vhiss score.  the chi-square test showed correspondence between gender and the  ccsvi-positive diagnosis (p = 0.05).  therefore, education and gender were controlled for in hypothesis  testing models.  there was no correspondence between ccsvi and depression as measured by the  bdifs.    the regression models predicting vhiss score after controlling for education and gender were  not statistically significant for any of the macfims predictor variables.  the largest partial r in the  analysis was -0.13 between cvltr delayed recall and the vhiss score (table 2).  the ancovas showed a significant effect of ccsvi-positive diagnosis on cognitive ability in one  of the 10 macfims outcomes (table 1, figure 2).  for bvmtr delayed recall, ccsvi-positive patients  showed better performance than their ccsvi-negative counterparts (p=0.009).  the direction of the 


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   8    effect was thus counter to expectation in that positive patients achieved a score of 9.1 compared to 7.8  for the ccsvi negative group.      discussion  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of neuropsychological status in ms patients in  relation to ccsvi. in this sample of 109 ms patients, we find no evidence of an association between  ccsvi and cognitive impairment.  moreover, no relationship between cognitive performance and the  severity of ccsvi criteria, as determined by ds, was detected in linear regression analysis.  when  patients were categorized by the ccsvi status (positive/negative), significant group differences emerged  for only one test, in a direction contrary to the hypothesis that ccsvi is a risk factor for cognitive  impairment in ms.  similarly, there was no relationship between ccsvi and depression in this cohort.      the ccsvi hypothesis has provoked great controversy and debate in the ms research  community since it was first presented [11, 13].  the hypothesis gained popularity amongst ms patients  because of the postulated possibility of venous insufficiency correction using endovascular procedures.   while the diagnosis of ccsvi can be established via noninvasive and invasive imaging techniques [12],  the validity of ds to establish the diagnosis of ccsvi remains controversial.  we showed previously that  ds, in properly trained hands, has high sensitivity and specificity for ccsvi diagnosis, when compared to  invasive imaging methods [49, 50].  this was the same method as used in this study, and thus we are  confident in the validity of the ccsvi categorization in our analysis.    the true prevalence of ccsvi in ms patients is unknown, and there is good evidence that the  condition is also found in patients with other neurologic diseases [23].  in this study, 64% of the  participating ms subjects presented with ccsvi, which is similar to our previous study [23].  the  difference between the prevalence rates of ccsvi positive vs negative in this study is modest, and of  uncertain meaning with respect to ms pathology.  indeed, emerging studies point against ccsvi having a 


benedict et al, cognition and ccsvi in ms   -   9    primary causative role in the development of ms [11, 13].  a multimodal approach will likely be needed  to determine the extent to which ccsvi is present in various healthy and disease groups, and ms  subtypes [15].   cognitive impairment is common in ms and can be reliably quantified via neuropsychological  tests emphasizing episodic memory, mental processing speed and some aspects of executive function  [51].  neuropsychological deficits are also robustly correlated with brain mri measures, especially   global and regional brain atrophy [52].  the heterogeneity of neuropsychological presentation among  ms patients is influenced by many factors, including genetics, gender, intelligence, disease course,  comorbid neuropsychiatric illness, and health behaviors.  the present study employed consensus  standard tests emphasizing multiple domains of cognitive function, allowing us to test, in a  comprehensive way, whether presence and severity of ccsvi can influence this important sphere of  disability in ms patients. no association between cognitive impairment and presence and severity of  ccsvi was found, which is consistent with our previous findings for lack of association between presence  of ccsvi and severity of lesion burden and brain atrophy outcomes in ms patients [53].   there are number of potential limitations in this study. selection of participants was based on  the basis of the inclusion or exclusion criteria in patients agreeing to undergo cognitive testing.  however, it may be that the most severe patients presenting in our center were not included in the  study. another potential limit is not inclusion of a control group. however, the aim of this study was not  to assess ccsvi prevalence, but an association with cognitive impairment. finally, the diagnosis of ccsvi  was not confirmed by use of other invasive diagnostic methods.    in conclusion, we find no evidence of an association between presence and severity of ccsvi  with cognitive impairment and depression in patients with ms.
