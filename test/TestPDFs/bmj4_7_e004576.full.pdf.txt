diuretics are currently used at relatively low doses, more likely in combination with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) and calcium antagonists, according to the clinical background of the patient, rather than as a single agent with dose titration. therefore, there is a need for assessment of the meta- bolic effects of treatment with low-dose diuretics rather than of those of diuretics per se. in addition, from the methodological point of view, as no study thus far has assessed the diabetogenic effect of diuretics as the primary end point, this study is being done to ﬁll that gap. although there is no universal agreement that thiazide diuretics are the ﬁrst-choice antihypertensive drug, evi- dence from clinical trials in ‘salt sensitive’ patients, such as allhat (antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial),5 and patho- physiological considerations regarding salt intake and blood pressure control, suggest that appropriate use of thiazide diuretics is undoubtedly necessary for a large subpopulation of hypertensive patients. this study of japanese patients with essential hyperten- sion was performed to assess the hypothesis that antihy- pertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics may not be associated with a higher risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities compared to treatment of such patients without diuretics. methods trial design this was an independent, investigator-initiated, multicen- tre, pragmatic, randomised, open, blinded-end point, par- allel group study conducted in japan (nct00131846). study setting this study was conducted in japan at hypertension clinics of 106 sites including general practitioners’ ofﬁces (n=61) and teaching hospitals (n=45). all members of committees for this diuretics in the management of essential hypertension (dime) study and the dime investigators who participated in the study settings, data collection and management are listed in the online supplementary appendix. participant patients were eligible if they were aged 30–79 years at randomisation, and had either untreated hypertension with systolic blood pressure of 150 mm hg or more, dia- stolic blood pressure of 90 mm hg or more, or both; or treated hypertension with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm hg or more, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm hg or more, or both. patients were excluded if they had type 2 diabetes, gout, systolic blood pressure of 200 mm hg or more, diastolic blood pressure of 120 mm hg or more, hypokalaemia (<3.5 mmol/l), erectile dysfunction, renal dysfunction (serum creatinine levels of 2.0 mg/dl or more), history of stroke or myo- cardial infarction within 3 months, history of revasculari- sation of coronary arteries within 6 months, heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <40%), history of serious adverse reaction to thiazide diuretics, or history of malignant tumour within 5 years. patients who were pregnant, breastfeeding, already on thiazide treatment or on any antihypertensive treatment if the duration of treatment and drugs used were not identi- ﬁed, and those deemed not eligible for this study for any other reason, were also excluded. assignment to study treatment eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive thia- zide diuretics at a low dose that was deﬁned as 12.5 mg/ day of hydrochlorothiazide, 1 mg/day of indapamide or 1 mg/day of trichloromethiazide along with any other antihypertensive drugs as required to achieve target blood pressure (<140/<90 mm hg) (diuretics group) or receive any antihypertensive drugs other than thiazide diuretics to achieve target blood pressure (<140/ <90 mm hg) (no-diuretics group) by minimisation method10 11 with assignment factors being impaired fasting glycaemia (fasting blood glucose ≥110 mg/dl or <110 mg/dl), family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and body mass index (≥25 or <25 kg/m2) and region of trial sites. concealment of assignment we developed a web-based minimisation system that was controlled by the data centre and effectively concealed the assignment sequence from investigators assessing and recruiting patients. follow-up schedule patients regularly visited their outpatient clinic monthly or bimonthly. sitting blood pressure, heart rate and plasma concentrations of fasting glucose, creatinine, uric acid, potassium and sodium were measured and recorded every 6 months. glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) and lipid proﬁles were measured yearly. end points and outcome measure the primary end point of dime study was new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. the secondary end points were all-cause mortality, ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes excluding transient ischaemic attacks and secondary causes, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation due to heart failure, gout, treatment-resistant hypokalaemia and peripheral artery disease including arteriosclerosis oblit- erans (aso), aortic aneurysm, blood pressure, lipid pro- ﬁles, hba1c, fasting blood glucose and direct cost. investigators submitted all information relevant to any of the potential end points to the data centre for review by the end point committee, who were blinded to the treatment assignment. we collected data continuously even after patients suffered a non-fatal secondary end point in order to assess whether onset of diabetes 2 ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 open access


occurs. diagnostic criteria for each end point were deﬁned a priori and were used by the end point com- mittee. brieﬂy, diagnosis of the primary end point was made according to who criteria 199812 and the criteria of the japanese diabetes society13 based on the results from regular assessment of blood glucose. gout was diagnosed according to the american college of rheumatology 1977 criteria c.14 treatment-resistant hypokalaemia was deﬁned as continuous hypokalaemia (<3.5 mmol/l) even after the addition of potassium- sparing drugs or potassium supplementation in patients without any evidence of secondary hypertension. diagnosis of stroke, myocardial infarction or heart failure was made by who monica project diagnostic criteria,15 aha scientiﬁc statement 200316 or diagnostic criteria of the framingham study,17 respectively. renal dysfunction was deﬁned as doubling of serum creatinine concentrations, of 4 mg/dl or more, or progression to end-stage renal disease (renal transplantation or haemo- dialysis). dissection of aortic aneurysm was diagnosed by medical history, symptoms and imaging. deterioration of aso was deﬁned according to the fontaine classiﬁcation.18 statistical analyses sample size the trial was designed as an equivalence trial, which was powered for equivalence of diuretics to no-diuretics group on the primary end point. with the assumption of 5.5% of occurrence of type 2 diabetes among diuretics and no-diuretics groups for 4 years based on the previous reports,19 20 955 patients per group would yield 90% power to detect equivalence with an equiva- lence margin of 3% at a level of two-sided type 1 error of 0.05 in one group. we also calculated that 713 patients per group would yield 80% power. thus, a total of 2400 and 1800 patients as the total sample size were to be enrolled, accommodating a possible 20% dropout during the follow-up period, in order to provide 90% and 80% power, respectively. evaluation of effects of antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics continuous variables were expressed as mean±sd or median with iqr. continuous variables were compared using the student t test or wilcoxon rank-sum test based on their distributions. clinical outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. each end point was assessed by the kaplan-meier method and compared by the log-rank test. time-to-events analysis of the primary end point should be justiﬁed because of regular assessment of glucose with short intervals. effect of treatment was compared by the cox proportional hazard model, and was expressed by hr with 95% ci. comparison was also made with the adjustment by assignment factors. as a sensitivity analysis, we compared incidence of diabetes diagnosed by who criteria only between the groups. treatment effect was evaluated in several prespeciﬁed subgroups, including stratiﬁed vari- ables, concomitant antihypertensives and dose of diure- tics as a subgroup analysis. in addition, we also performed on-treatment analysis to assure results from intention-to treat analysis. no-diuretics group was deﬁned as patients receiving no diuretics throughout the study period and diuretics group was deﬁned as patients receiving diuretics at the end of the observation period irrespective of allocated treatment. the study stat- istician conducted all statistical analyses with the use of jmp v.8.0 and sas v.9.3 (sas institute inc, cary, north carolina, usa). all reported p values were two-sided with the signiﬁcance level set at α=0.05. results the recruitment of patients was started on 5 april 2004 and terminated on 7 february 2012 despite insufﬁcient statistical power at that point because the steering commit- tee thought that further extension would not promote the enrolment of patients. the follow-up was then terminated at the end of august 2012. we did not conduct interim analyses because of insufﬁcient enrolment of patients. 1130 patients were randomised (ﬁgure 1). randomised patients were similar between groups with regard to demo- graphic and clinical characteristics (table 1). complete end point information was collected at the end of the study for 1049 (92.9%) participants after a median follow-up of 4.4 years (ﬁgure 1). twenty-ﬁve (2.2%) patients withdrew consent and 56 (4.9%) were lost to follow-up. at the end of follow-up, 75% of participants ran- domly assigned to diuretic group were still taking thiazide diuretics and 6% of participants assigned to no-diuretics group were taking thiazide diuretics. approximately 80% of patients received ras inhibitors and approximately 20% of them received β-blockers in diuretics and no-diuretics groups at the end of follow-up period (table 2). the primary end point and glucose-related outcome the primary end point of new onset of type 2 diabetes did not differ signiﬁcantly between the groups (ﬁgure 2). during the study, diabetes developed in 25 (4.6%) parti- cipants in the diuretics group, as compared with 29 (4.9%) in the no-diuretics group (hr 0.93; 95% ci 0.54 to 1.59; log-rank test: p=0.800). actual statistical power became 60%. comparison by the cox proportional hazard model with the adjustment by assignment vari- ables showed similar results (hr 0.91; 95% ci 0.53 to 1.58; p=0.741). the incidence of diabetes was 19 in no-diuretics and 19 in diuretics groups when diagnosed according to who criteria only. there was no signiﬁcant difference between the groups (hr 1.07, 95% ci 0.56 to 2.03, p=0.8438). although statistically underpowered, sub- group analysis did not identify any factors interacting with effects of use of diuretics on development of dia- betes (ﬁgure 3). on treatment analysis there was no sig- niﬁcant difference in incidence of type 2 diabetes ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 3 open access

serum potassium levels were very slightly but signiﬁcantly lower by 0.1 mmol/l in the diuretics group than those in the no-diuretics group. serum sodium levels at the end of follow-up period were also slightly but signiﬁ- cantly lower by <1 mmol/l in the diuretics group than those in no-diuretics group (table 3). averaged serum uric acid concentrations overtime and at the end of follow-up period were shown in ﬁgure 5b and table 3, respectively. from 0.5 to 4.5 years during the study period and at the end of follow-up period, serum uric acid levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the diuretics group than those in the no-diuretics group. there were no signiﬁcant differences in estimated glomerular ﬁltra- tion rate and lipid proﬁle between the groups (table 3). blood pressure there was no signiﬁcant difference in blood pressure between the groups during the study or at the end of follow-up period (ﬁgure 6 and table 3). discussion we demonstrate that the incidence of type 2 diabetes was not higher in our japanese patients with essential hypertension receiving antihypertensive treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics compared to those treated without diuretics although statistically underpowered for equivalency. consistency between intention-to-treat ana- lysis and on-treatment analysis might assure our conclu- sion. a lack of adverse effects of low-dose diuretics on glucose metabolism, represented by fasting glucose levels and hba1c (which were consistent with the inci- dence of diabetes), was also demonstrated. unlike our results, a recent meta-analysis of 22 clinical trials showed that diuretics use was associated with a greater risk of new onset of diabetes compared to other antihypertensive drugs and placebo in hypertensive patients.6 we assume that differences in the dose of diuretics used, concurrent antihypertensive drugs used with diuretics and the study design may explain different results regarding incidence of diabetes. doses of thiazide diuretics in most studies included in the meta-analysis by elliot and meyer were higher (25 mg of hydrochlorothia- zide or more) than those used in the current study. similarly, although bakris et al21 showed that the ﬁxed combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide impaired glucose tolerance in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome, the dose of this combination was titrated to 100 mg of losartan and 25 mg of hydrochlor- othiazide in approximately 80% of patients. as carlsen et al22 showed previously, there is a clear relationship between dose of thiazide diuretics and effect on glucose, table 2 concurrent drug treatment at the baseline and the end of follow-up at the baseline after randomisation at the end of follow-up diuretics group (n=544) no-diuretics group (n=586) diuretics group (n=504) no-diuretics group (n=565) thiazide diuretics 518 (98.9) 0 (0) 379 (75.2) 32 (5.7) ace inhibitors 53 (10.1) 86 (14.9) 42 (8.3) 70 (12.4) arb 292 (55.7) 388 (67.0) 349 (69.3) 377 (66.7) ca antagonist 284 (54.2) 437 (75.5) 313 (62.1) 436 (77.2) β-blocker 99 (18.9) 132 (22.8) 107 (21) 132 (23) α-blocker 12 (2.3) 34 (5.9) 18 (3.6) 30 (5.3) anti-aldosterone 6 (1.2) 13 (2.3) 23 (4.6) 31 (5.5) others 1 (0.2) 1 (0.2) 2 (0.4) 4 (0.7) statins 140 (26.7) 141 (24.4) 188 (37.3) 211 (37.4) antiplatelet 80 (15.3) 73 (12.6) 87 (17.3) 82 (14.5) k supplement 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0.2) 2 (0.4) drugs for hyperuricaemia 34 (6.5) 36 (6.2) 58 (11.5) 51 (9.0) data are number (%). arb, angiotensin receptor blocker. figure 2 kaplan–meier curves of cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes. ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 5 open access


potassium and uric acid but not blood pressure. results from our study suggest that treatment with diuretics at the dose of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide equivalent may not increase the risk for new onset of diabetes; that is, the diabetogenic effect of thiazide diuretics may also be dose dependent. one might claim that there is no evidence to support that diuretics at the doses used in this study reduce cardiovascular events. however, improved cardiovascular outcome can be expected as long as target blood pressure is achieved by a combin- ation of drugs including thiazide diuretics even at low doses (12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent). figure 3 effects of diuretics use on risk of new onset of diabetes according to the baseline characteristics. fbs, fasting blood sugar; bmi, body mass index; acei/arb, ace inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. figure 4 plasma fasting glucose (a) and glycated hemoglobin (b) over time by groups. 6 ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 open access


it is of note that almost 80% of patients in the diuretic use group of our study used inhibitors of ras, while β-blockers were the main combination drug with diuretics in most studies included in the meta-analysis such as allhat study.5 the combination of diuretics and inhibitors of ras is common in current clinical practice and appears to be associated with a lesser risk of diabetes compared to the combination with a β-blocker, as shown by the life (losartan intervention for end point reduction in hypertension) study.23 therefore, it can be assumed that current therapeutic strategy with diuretics at low doses mostly combined with ras inhibitors does not carry a high risk for diabetes. however, we could not show clear interactions of concur- rent drugs (β-blockers and ras inhibitors) and the risk for diabetes in subgroup analysis, largely because the study was underpowered. recently, subanalysis of the navigator (nateglinide and valsartan in impaired glucose tolerance outcomes research) study demon- strated that use of diuretics was associated with excess risk for type 2 diabetes.24 there is, however, limitation in the interpretation of this result because use of diuretics was not randomised and the doses of diuretics were not as low as our study. our study is, as far as we know, the ﬁrst randomised, controlled trial to assess, as the primary end point, risk in essential hypertensive patients for new onset of dia- betes associated with treatment by thiazide diuretics. most studies showing a higher risk for diabetes from diuretics use were primarily designed to assess cardiovas- cular events as the primary end point, and new onset of diabetes was assessed by post hoc analysis or, at best, as a prespeciﬁed secondary end point. the mechanisms responsible for the increased inci- dence of diabetes with use of thiazide diuretics at a high dose have not been fully elucidated. a recent quantita- tive review showed that thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose.25 in the current study, no clinically signiﬁcant difference in averaged plasma potassium levels were seen during the observa- tion period, which may be attributable to the low dose of diuretics and frequent use of ras inhibitors, and may partly explain why no difference in the incidence of dia- betes between the groups was found. serum uric acid levels during the study were signiﬁ- cantly higher in the diuretic group than were those in the no-diuretics group. this may suggest that elevation of uric acid cannot be avoided even by use of low dose with ras inhibitors. however, the clinical signiﬁcance of such a small elevation of uric acid is unclear, because treatment with diuretics did not increase the incidence of gout, which is consistent with results from another epidemiological study, in which no signiﬁcant increase in risk for gout was seen with use of lower doses of diure- tics (12.5 mg/day in hydrochlorothiazide equivalents).26 limitation of our study as we could not achieve the target sample size, our study is statistically underpowered for the assessment of table 3 blood pressure, glucose, uric acid, electrolytes, renal function and lipid profile at the end of follow-up diuretics group (n=544) no-diuretics group (n=586) p value systolic bp (mm hg) 135 (16) 135 (15) 0.900 diastolic bp (mm hg) 78 (11) 77 (11) 0.800 pulse rate (bpm) 73 (11) 73 (11) 0.998 fasting glucose (mg/dl) 102 (14) 103 (16) 0.423 hba1c (%) 5.4 (0.4) 5.4 (0.4) 0.194 uric acid (mg/dl) 5.8 (1.4) 5.6 (1.3) 0.044 k (mmol/l) 4.1 (0.4) 4.2 (0.4) 0.005 na (mmol/l) 140.7 (2.4) 141.0 (2.2) 0.038 egfr (ml/min/1.73 m2) 68.8 (16.7) 69.6 (16.4) 0.448 total cholesterol (mg/dl) 197 (32) 197 (33) 0.828 hdl cholesterol (mg/dl) 59 (16) 59 (16) 0.492 triglyceride (mg/dl) 138 (104) 131 (71) 0.201 data are mean (sd). p values indicate statistical difference between groups. si conversion factors: to convert total and hdl cholesterol and triglyceride to mmol/l, multiply values by 0.0259 and 0.0113, respectively. to convert glucose and uric acid to mmol/l and μmol/l, multiply values by 0.0555 and 59.48, respectively. bp, blood pressure; egfr, estimated glomerular filtration rate; hba1c, glycated haemoglobin; hdl, high-density lipoprotein. table 4 incidence of secondary end points diuretics group (n=544) no-diuretics group (n=586) gout 6 (1.2) 7 (1.3) treatment resistant hypokalaemia 2 (0.4) 1 (0.2) stroke 11 (2.2) 5 (1.1) myocardial infarction 2 (0.4) 5 (1.0) heart failure 2 (0.4) 6 (1.1) peripheral arterial disease 2 (0.4) 3 (0.5) renal dysfunction 1 (0.2) 1 (0.2) sudden death 0 (0.0) 1 (0.2) data are number (%). ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 7 open access


equivalency. therefore we are able to state that we found no evidence of a difference in outcome, but not that the treatments were equivalent in terms of inci- dence of diabetes. we conducted a pragmatic trial for the assessment of effectiveness of treatment with low-dose diuretics but not the efﬁcacy of the diuretics per se by using an unblinded study design without any prespeciﬁed therapeutic algorithm, which may have impaired internal validity to some extent partly because of clustering of antihypertensives or other drugs such as drugs for hyperuricaemia. the ascertainment bias was much less likely even though it was an open study without placebo because we regularly assessed the incidence of diabetes for all patients. however, given that time course of develop- ment of type 2 diabetes is uncertain, validity of diagnosis of diabetes in trials such as ours is limited. conclusion results from the present randomised controlled trial suggest that current practice of antihypertensive treat- ment with thiazide diuretics at low doses may not be associated with increased risk for new onset of type 2 diabetes or other clinically signiﬁcant metabolic abnor- malities. these results might suggest safety of use of low doses of thiazide diuretics. author affiliations 1department of clinical pharmacology & therapeutics, university of the ryukyus, okinawa, japan 2department of internal medicine, hyogo collage of medicine, nishinomiya, japan 3department of cardiology, saiseikai-futsukaichi hospital, chikushino, japan 4sleep apnea centre, kyushu university hospital, fukuoka, japan 5department of medicine, university of the ryukyus, okinawa, japan 6division of hypertension and renal medicine, national cardiovascular research centre, suita, japan 7department of medicine, sapporo medical university, sapporo, japan 8department of geriatric medicine, osaka university, suita, japan 9department of medicine, keio university, tokyo, japan contributors tm had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. su, tm, s-ia, s-it, yk, ks, to and ts participated in development of the study protocol. su, tm and s-ia supervised data collection and management. tm conducted the statistical analyses. su led the writing of the report, which was co-led by tm and assisted by all other authors. while tm figure 5 serum potassium (a, *p=0.007, **p=0.002, †p=0.020, ††p=0.004) and uric acid (b, *p<0.0001, **p=0.0004, †p=0.0008, ††p=0.002, ¶p=0.049, §p=0.010) concentrations over time by treatment groups. figure 6 blood pressure over time by treatment groups. 8 ueda s, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004576. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004576 open access
