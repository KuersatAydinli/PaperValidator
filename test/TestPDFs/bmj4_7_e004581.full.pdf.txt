wenfeini@yeah.net abstract objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (accf) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (acdf) for treating two-adjacent-level cervical spondylosis myelopathy (csm). design: a meta-analysis of the two anterior fusion methods was conducted. the electronic databases of pubmed, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, sciencedirect, cnki, wanfang data and cqvip were searched. quality assessment of the included studies was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias tool and the methodological index for non-randomised studies criteria. pooled risk ratios of dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean differences (smds) of continuous outcomes were generated. using the χ2 and i2 tests, the statistical heterogeneity was assessed. subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. participants: nine eligible trials with a total of 631 patients and a male-to-female ratio of 1.38:1 were included in this meta-analysis. inclusion criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) and non-randomised controlled trials that adopted accf and acdf to treat two-adjacent-level csm were included. results: no significant differences were identified between the two groups regarding hospital stay, the japanese orthopaedic association ( joa) score, visual analogue scale (vas) scores for neck and arm pain, total cervical range of motion (rom), fusion rom, fusion rate, adjacent-level ossification and complications, while acdf had significantly less bleeding (smd=1.14, 95% ci (0.74 to 1.53)); a shorter operation time (smd=1.13, 95% ci (0.82 to 1.45)); greater cervical lordosis, total cervical (smd=−2.95, 95% ci (−4.79 to −1.12)) and fused segment (smd=−2.24, 95% ci (−3.31 to −1.17)); higher segmental height (smd=−0.68, 95% ci (−1.03 to −0.34)) and less graft subsidence (smd=0.40, 95% ci (0.06 to 0.75)) compared to accf. conclusions: the results suggested that acdf has more advantages compared to accf. however, additional high- quality rcts and a longer follow-up duration are needed. introduction cervical spondylosis is a common disease and a progressive degenerative process of the cervical spine that results in loss of disc height and formation of osteophytes. when it develops into cervical spondylosis myelop- athy (csm), motion abnormalities and sensory disturbances will follow, resulting in a reduced quality of life for the patients.1 surgical intervention is recommended for these patients with severe symptoms.2 the choice between an anterior, posterior or combined approach for decompression is based primarily on (1) the sagittal alignment of the spinal column, (2) the extent of disease, (3) the location of the abnormal compression, (4) the presence of preopera- tive neck pain and (5) previous operations.2 shamji et al3 and jiang et al4 have reviewed the efﬁcacy and safety of anterior procedures for patients with multilevel csm, covering patients with two-adjacent-level csm. furthermore, the work by chang et al5 supports that anterior cer- vical discectomy and fusion (acdf) is the treat- ment of choice for cervical disc herniation and spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. in addition, lu et al6 have shown that anterior cer- vical corpectomy and fusion (accf) is an effect- ive surgical procedure for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy because it can strengths and limitations of this study ▪ according to our study, anterior cervical corpect- omy and fusion (accf) and anterior cervical disc- ectomy and fusion (acdf) are effective and safe for treating cervical spondylosis myelopathy. ▪ acdf has more advantages than accf in some aspects. ▪ the trials included in our study are not high- quality randomised controlled trials and do not have a long enough follow-up duration. ▪ the number of studies used in the meta-analysis is small (nine studies). in fact, for most of the outcomes, fewer than five studies were used in the meta-analyses. ▪ the pathological processes of patients are not always the same. huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 1 open access research group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


remove almost all osteophytes, discs and ossiﬁcation of pos- terior longitudinal ligament pathology that cause spinal cord compression. yonenobu et al7 and kawakami et al8 have shown that acdf and accf are widely used anterior methods for csm, especially with two levels. although patients with two-adjacent-level csm are often seen in clin- ical practice, controversies still exist between accf and acdf for treating these patients. therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of accf and acdf for patients with two-adjacent-level csm by asses- sing the perioperative, clinical and radiological outcomes as well as complications. materials and methods search strategy the electronic databases including pubmed (1966–2013), the cochrane central register of controlled trials (issue 9, 2013), sciencedirect (1985–2013), cnki (1996–2013), wanfang data (1997–2013) and cqvip (1996–2013) were searched. the keywords used for the search were as follows: ‘cervical spondylosis myelopathy,’ ‘anterior cer- vical discectomy and fusion,’ ‘anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion,’ ‘two level(s)’ and ‘single-level.’ eligibility criteria all comparative studies that adopted accf and acdf to treat two-adjacent-level cervical spondylosis were identi- ﬁed, and the reference lists of identiﬁed articles were searched to identify other potentially eligible studies. criteria for inclusion were as follows: (1) accf with titanium mesh, cage or autologous ilium bone grafting; acdf with interbody cage devices or autologous ilium bone grafting; and the two surgeries used anterior cer- vical plate and screw ﬁxation. (2) all patients included had a conﬁrmed csm at two adjacent segments, and sur- gical intervention was recommended. (3) the trials were followed up for more than 12 months. criteria for exclusion were as follows: (1) the studies did not meet the inclusion criteria. (2) the intraopera- tive outcome data (length of hospital stay, amount of bleeding and operation time), clinical outcomes ( japanese orthopaedic association ( joa) score and visual analogue scale (vas) score for neck and arm pain), radiological outcomes (cervical lordosis for total cervical and fused segments, total cervical range of motion (rom), segmental rom, graft collapse, segmen- tal height, fusion rate and degeneration of the adjacent level) or complications (short-term and long-term com- plications) were not reported. (3) the number of samples was less than 30 cases. (4) the patients evalu- ated were treated at the same hospital. data extraction two reviewers independently extracted the data using a standardised form, which covered the following items: (1) basic characteristics, including the year of publica- tion, study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, age, sex, enrolled number and follow-up rate; (2) intraoperative outcomes, consisting of length of hospital stay, amount of bleeding and operation time; (3) clinical outcomes, including joa score and vas score for neck and arm pain; (4) radiological outcomes, such as cervical lordosis for total cervical and fused segments, total cervical rom, segmental rom, graft collapse, segmental height, fusion rate, degeneration of the adjacent level and (5) complications, including short-term and long-term complications. risk of bias assessment two reviewers independently evaluated the quality of the included studies. three randomised studies9–11 were assessed with the cochrane handbook for systematic review of interventions, and six non-randomised studies12–17 were evaluated according to the methodo- logical index for non-randomised studies (minors) cri- teria, an established method for evaluating non-rcts.18 statistical analysis all meta-analyses were performed with review manager 5.2 software (cochrane collaboration, oxford, uk). for continuous outcomes, means and sds were pooled to generate a standardised mean difference (smd) and 95% cis were generated. according to the study by kim et al,17 a formula was used to obtain a combined mean and sd.19 for dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio (rr) and 95% ci were assessed. a probability of p<0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. assessment for statistical heterogeneity was calculated using the χ2 and i2 tests. when the test for heterogeneity was p<0.1 or i2>50%, the data were considered very het- erogeneous. the source of heterogeneity was investi- gated by subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. a ﬁxed effects model was used for homogeneous data, and a random effects model was used for data with high het- erogeneity. as for the data with signiﬁcant methodo- logical heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis was adopted to ﬁnd the source of the heterogeneity. with regard to the data with signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were applied to identify the source of the heterogeneity. results literature search a total of 606 potential reports were retrieved with the search strategy (ﬁgure 1). of these, 597 reports were excluded because they did not ﬁt our inclusion criteria. no additional studies were obtained after the reference review. finally, nine studies were selected and analysed.9–17 risk of bias assessment for three randomised studies,9–11 two studies were rcts,9 11 one of which did not provide information regarding allocation concealment. one study was a 2 huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


quasi-rct, in which patients were allocated according to their sequence of hospitalisation.10 owing to the informed consent rights between patients and doctors, it was impossible to blind all participants and personnel. none of these three studies reported blinding of outcome assessment. no patients were lost to follow-up, except for eight patients who were excluded from the study by liu et al11 due to missing data. thus, there was a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. in these three trials, the outcomes were provided in detail and there was a low risk of bias due to selective report- ing. owing to insufﬁcient information to assess whether an important risk of bias existed in a number of trials, it was hypothesised that all trials had an unclear risk of bias towards other potential sources of bias. the meth- odological quality assessment is summarised in table 1. for six non-randomised studies,12–17 according to the modiﬁed minors criteria,18 none of them reported an unbiased assessment of the study end point or a pro- spective calculation of the study size. with regard to the prospective collection of data, three studies did not report the relevant information.13 15 17 only one study reported the follow-up rate.14 the other eight items were all speciﬁcally reported. in summary, scores ranged from 16 to 18, with a median value of 16.5. the meth- odological quality assessment is summarised in table 2. demographic characteristics the demographic characteristics of the patients included in the selected studies are presented in table 3. a total of 631 patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.38:1, were included. of these, 270 underwent accf procedures and 361 were treated by the acdf approach; the two surgeries used various grafts, including auto- grafts, allografts and cage and/or plate systems. the mean age of the patients was 55.1 years. the average duration of follow-up ranged from 18.9 to 43.2 months. statistically similar baseline characteristics were observed between the accf and acdf groups (table 4). figure 1 the search strategy for our meta-analysis and reasons for exclusion. table 1 risk of bias assessment of randomised studies risk of bias assessment oh et al9 yu et al10 liu et al11 random sequence generation unclear risk high risk low risk allocation concealment unclear risk unclear risk unclear risk blinding of participants and personnel high risk high risk high risk blinding of outcome assessment unclear risk unclear risk unclear risk incomplete outcome data low risk low risk low risk selective reporting low risk low risk low risk other sources of bias unclear risk unclear risk unclear risk huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


hospital stay details regarding hospital stay were available in three papers (see online supplementary table s1),9 11 16 and statistical heterogeneity was absent in these studies (i2=0%; p=0.69). the pooled estimate revealed a statistic- ally insigniﬁcant difference (smd=0.18, 95% ci (−0.15 to 0.51), p=0.28) (ﬁgure 2). bleeding amount relevant data regarding the bleeding amount were documented in four articles (see online supplementary table s1),9–11 16 and all the trials showed that the acdf approach had signiﬁcantly reduced intraoperative bleed- ing amounts compared to the accf procedure. pooling of relevant data also showed a statistically signiﬁcant dif- ference between the two groups (smd=1.14, 95% ci (0.74 to 1.53), p=0.002). signiﬁcant heterogeneity was detected (i2=89%; p<0.00001) (ﬁgure 2b). in addition, sensitivity analysis conﬁrmed the stability of bleeding amount outcomes (see online supplementary ﬁgure s1). operation time four trials reported a signiﬁcantly shorter surgical time in the acdf group compared to the accf group (see online supplementary table s1).9–11 16 overall, the smd was 1.13 (95% ci (0.82 to 1.45), p< 0.00001) in favour of the acdf group. there was obvious evidence of statis- tically signiﬁcant heterogeneity (i2=54%; p=0.009), according to the subgroup analysis (ﬁgure 3). furthermore, sensitivity analysis conﬁrmed the stability of operation time outcomes (see online supplementary ﬁgure s2). japanese orthopaedic association three studies reported the joa score (see online sup- plementary table s2),9 11 16 and the pooled estimate revealed a statistically insigniﬁcant difference (smd=0.14, 95% ci (−0.19 to 0.47), p=0.41), with low heterogeneity (i2=12%) (ﬁgure 4a). neck vas three studies reported a postoperative neck vas score (see online supplementary table s2),9 14 16 and the pooled data from the two relevant studies did not reveal any signiﬁcant difference (smd=0.13, 95% ci (−0.15 to 0.41), p=0.36), with low heterogeneity (i2=45%) (ﬁgure 4b). arm vas relevant vas data were documented in three articles (see online supplementary table s2).9 14 16 there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two treatment groups (smd=−0.15, 95%ci (−0.43 to 0.13); p=0.28), with low heterogeneity (i2=4%; ﬁgure 4c). c2–c7 cobb five studies reported the c2–c7 cobb at the ﬁnal follow-up (see online supplementary table s3a);9 12 14 16 17 the available data demonstrated low het- erogeneity (i2=8%), and the accf group had a signiﬁ- cantly lower cobb than the acdf group (smd=−0.32, 95% ci (−0.53 to −0.10), p=0.004; ﬁgure 5a). fusion cobb three studies reported the fusion cobb at the ﬁnal follow-up (see online supplementary table s3a);11 12 15 the available data demonstrated no heterogeneity (i2=0%), and the accf group had a signiﬁcantly lower cobb than the acdf group (smd=−0.50, 95% ci (−0.75 to −0.24), p=0.0001; ﬁgure 5b). total cervical rom two studies reported the total cervical rom data at the ﬁnal follow-up (see online supplementary table s3b),9 16 and the other two studies demonstrated that there was no signiﬁcant difference in total cervical rom between the two groups (smd=−0.02, 95% ci (−0.42 to 0.37), p=0.90), with no heterogeneity (i2=0%; ﬁgure 5c). table 2 quality assessment of non-randomised studies methodological item for non-randomised studies park et al12 wang et al13 burkhardt et al14 yu et al15 jia et al16 kim et al17 1. a clearly stated aim 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. inclusion of consecutive patients 2 2 2 2 2 2 3. prospective collection of data 2 0 2 0 2 0 4. end points appropriate to the aim of the study 2 2 2 2 2 2 5. unbiased assessment of the study end point 0 0 0 0 0 0 6. follow-up period appropriate to the aim of the study 2 2 2 2 2 2 7. loss to follow-up less than 5% 0 0 1 0 0 0 8. prospective calculation of the study size 0 0 0 0 0 0 9. an adequate control group 2 2 2 2 2 2 10. contemporary groups 2 2 2 2 2 2 11. baseline equivalence of groups 2 2 2 2 2 2 12. adequate statistical analyses 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


fusion rom two studies reported fusion rom at the last follow-up (see online supplementary table s3b),9 16 and there was no signiﬁcant difference in fusion rom between the two groups (smd=−0.05, 95% ci (−0.45 to 0.35), p=0.80), with low heterogeneity (i2=20%; ﬁgure 5d). fused segment height five studies reported the fused segment height data at the ﬁnal follow-up (see online supplementary table s3b)9 11 14 16 17; however, data from three studies were excluded from this analysis because of the different methods used to measure the fused segment height.11 16 17 the pooled results demonstrated that the accf group had a signiﬁcantly lower fused segment height than the acdf group (smd=−0.68, 95% ci (−1.03 to −0.34)), with high heterogeneity (i2=76%; ﬁgure 6a). graft collapse two studies reported graft collapse at the last follow-up (see online supplementary table s3c),12 15 showing that there was a signiﬁcant reduction in graft collapse for the acdf group (smd=0.40, 95% ci (0.06 to 0.75), p=0.02), with moderate heterogeneity (i2=68%; ﬁgure 6b). no signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity or meth- odological heterogeneity was found; however, statistical heterogeneity most likely exists, so the data from the two studies were pooled. fusion rate six studies reported the fusion rate at the last follow-up (see online supplementary table s3c),9 10 14–17 and there was no signiﬁcant difference in the fusion rate between the two groups (rr=1.00, 95% ci (0.97 to 1.04), p=0.79), with no heterogeneity (i2=0%; ﬁgure 7a). degeneration three studies reported degeneration of the level adjacent to the fusion (see online supplementary table s3c),9 14 15 showing that there was no signiﬁcant difference in degen- eration of the level adjacent to the fusion between the two groups (rr=1.31, 95% ci (0.44 to 3.93), p=0.63), with no heterogeneity (i2=0%; ﬁgure 7b). complications data regarding complications were provided in eight studies (see online supplementary table s4).9–11 13–17 there was no signiﬁcant difference between the accf and acdf groups according to individual and pooled data (rr=1.25, 95%ci=(0.74 to 2.13); p=0.40). statistical heterogeneity was absent in these studies (i2=0%; p=0.52; ﬁgure 7c). discussion although most studies included in this analysis reported consistent results,9–17 the pooled estimates should be explained with caution. with regard to the operative ta bl e 3 c ha ra ct er is tic s of th e st ud ie s in cl ud ed in th e m et a- an al ys is y ea rr ef d es ig n s am pl e si ze m ea n ag e (y ea rs ) g en de r (m /f ) m ea n fo llo w -u p tim e (m on th s) a c c f a c d f a c c f a c d f a c c f a c d f a c c f a c d f 20 09 9 r c t 17 14 55 .1 2 52 .6 4 16 /1 5 27 .3 3 24 .9 20 07 1 0 q ua si -r c t 20 20 53 .1 ±8 .9 8 52 .7 5± 7. 81 14 /6 15 /5 n a 20 11 1 1 r c t 23 23 54 .4 ±1 0. 9 56 .5 ±9 .2 18 /5 16 /7 31 (2 5– 53 ) 29 (2 6– 48 ) 20 10 1 2 r et ro 52 45 49 .4 ±8 .7 49 .3 ±9 .7 30 /2 2 17 /2 8 23 .3 ±6 .6 25 .7 ±6 .2 20 01 1 3 r et ro 20 32 51 .5 (1 7– 80 ) 27 /2 5 43 .2 (2 4– 84 ) 20 13 1 4 r et ro 38 80 60 .3 ±1 1. 1 60 .9 ±9 .9 25 /1 3 41 /3 9 20 .4 ±1 3. 7 20 12 1 5 r et ro 48 62 59 .3 ±6 .8 (4 9– 75 ) 65 /4 5 32 ±4 .2 (2 4– 60 ) 20 12 1 6 r et ro 36 31 48 .8 3± 8. 12 49 .1 2± 7. 65 21 /1 5 17 /1 4 28 .9 6± 13 .2 1 26 .8 1± 11 .0 2 20 12 1 7 r et ro 16 54 58 ±8 .6 56 .7 ±1 0. 2 13 /3 31 /2 3 20 ±1 1. 9 18 .6 ±1 1. 5 r et ro m ea nt re tro sp ec tiv e, m ea n ag e w as de sc rib ed as m ea n± s d or m ea n or m ea n (r an ge ) of al lp at ie nt s in th e st ud y or m ea n± s d of al lp at ie nt s in th e st ud y, ge nd er w as de sc rib ed as m /f or m /f of al lp at ie nt s in th e st ud y, m ea n fo llo w -u p tim e w as pr es en te d as m ea n± s d or m ea n (r an ge ) or m ea n± s d of al lp at ie nt s in th e st ud y. a c c f, an te rio r ce rv ic al co rp ec to m y an d fu si on ;a c d f, an te rio r ce rv ic al di sc ec to m y an d fu si on ;n a ,n ot av ai la bl e; r c t, ra nd om is ed co nt ro lt ria l. huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 5 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


outcomes, the length of hospital stay was similar in both groups, and less blood loss and a shorter operation time were observed in the acdf group than in the accf group. acdf requires less exposure of the spinal cord than does corpectomy2; therefore, less damage to the spinal column occurs. accordingly, acdf might result in less blood loss than accf. in terms of accf, a 15–19 mm anterior midline trough should be per- formed in the vertebral body down to the posterior lon- gitudinal ligament or dura, with removal of the cephalad and caudad discs,2 which would require more time to be removed; similarly it will cost more time to obtain a graft material to ﬁt the trough. consequently, acdf had a signiﬁcantly shorter operation time. in our meta-analysis, joa scores as well as vas scores for neck and arm pain signiﬁcantly improved in each group, without signiﬁcant differences between the two groups. these results suggest that both procedures effectively treat two-adjacent-level csm and improve the patients’ neurological function, quality of life and dis- ability. similar outcomes were achieved for acdf and accf in the treatment of multilevel cervical spondylosis by shamji et al3 and jiang et al.4 total cervical rom, fusion rom, fusion rate and adjacent-level ossiﬁcation yielded no signiﬁcant differ- ences between the two groups. concerning the high- fusion rate in the two groups, it may be related to the following factors: (1) the use of a polyether ether ketone table 4 comparison of baseline characteristics between the accf and acdf groups characteristic oh et al9 park et al12 wang et al13 burkhardt et al14 yu et al15 yu et al10 jia et al16 liu et al11 kim et al17 mean age * * * * * * * * * gender * * * * * * * * * follow-up * * * * * * * * * preoperative joa * na na na na * * * na preoperative neck vas * na na * na na * na na preoperative arm vas * na na * na na * na na preoperative sagittal alignment na * na na * na na na na preoperative c2–c7 cobb * * na * na na * na * preoperative fused segment height * na na * na na na * * preoperative total cervical rom * na na na na na 0.02 na na preoperative fused segment rom * na na na na na 0.01 na na *statistically insignificant (p>0.05). joa, japanese orthopaedic association scores; na, not available; rom, range of motion; vas, visual analogue scale scores. figure 2 perioperative parameters.

(peek) cage or titanium mesh packed with autogenous tricortical bone and ﬁxed by titanium plates and screws or by atlantis plate ﬁxation9–17; (2) the ﬁxation system provides a stable biomechanical environment, which greatly promotes bone healing; and (3) bone healing is a process of creeping substitution,20 and the distance of creeping substitution for single-level accf and two-level acdf are short. the high-fusion rate effectively reduced the total cervical and fused segment rom. for example, eck et al21 demonstrated that a signiﬁcantly greater adja- cent level disc pressure was achieved after cervical fusion. in addition, the normal degenerative process plays a major role through impaired nutrition, loss of viable cells, matrix protein modiﬁcation and matrix failure.22 this normal ageing process, in combination with increased mechanical pressures, may synergistically hasten the degeneration process, although it has not been conclusively demonstrated.23 figure 3 perioperative parameters. forest plot and tabulated data for operation time; the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion group had a significantly shorter surgical time compared to the anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion group. figure 4 clinical parameters.

for c2–c7 cobb, acdf had a signiﬁcantly greater lor- dosis angle than accf, not only immediately postopera- tion but also at the ﬁnal follow-up. similar results were found for the fusion cobb at the last follow-up. the reasons may be associated with the following two factors: (1) single-level accf removes the vertebral body and two discs, while two-level acdf just takes out the two discs2; as a result, acdf allows the construction of an almost normal spinal column after surgery. thus, the loss of cobb is less common in acdf. in other words, acdf preserves the sagittal alignment somewhat better than does accf. (2) eck et al21 have reported that each of the involved joints contributes to the total rom. with fusion, the contribution of one joint to rom is reduced. in terms of the fused segment height, accf causes a signiﬁcant reduction compared to acdf, both immedi- ately postoperative and at the last follow-up. with acdf, screws placed in the intervening segment and two caudal end plates synergistically share the load of the construct. in contrast, with a single-level corpectomy, screws are only at the cranial and caudal vertebral seg- ments and the caudal end plate bears the full load of the construct.12 additionally, the graft contact area is less for accf than for acdf, which results in a higher shear stress for accf. these reasons might hasten the graft absorption process into the cover plate of the adja- cent vertebral body, leading to a signiﬁcant subsidence of the treated segment in accf, especially at the anter- ior and caudal positions. concerning complications, the data show that there is no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups and that the incidence of complications is low in each group. this result suggests that both the treatments are safe. figure 5 radiological parameters.

the methodological quality assessment should be con- sidered, which identiﬁed several limitations of the clin- ical evidence. only nine studies met the predeﬁned eligibility criteria, meaning that all the results were based on only 631 patients. more importantly, there were only three studies that were randomised. all rando- mised studies had poor concealment of randomisation, including selection and allocation bias. owing to informed consent requirements, patients and operators had knowledge regarding the surgical procedures, thus allowing further measurement and expectation bias. four outcomes (bleeding amount, operation time, fused segment height and graft collapse) had a high hetero- geneity. wu et al24 have summarised a method to deal with heterogeneity in meta-analysis. for the bleeding amount, it was reasonable to perform sensitivity analysis (see online supplementary ﬁgure s1) because of the dif- ferent research types. as shown in online supplementary ﬁgure s1, the results of jia et al16 have signiﬁcant hetero- geneity, which should be removed. the bleeding amount results are shown in ﬁgure 2b. regarding the operation time, sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the data because of the different research types. as shown by the sensitivity analysis results (see online supplementary ﬁgure s2), acdf had a shorter operation time that could not be reversed regardless of which study was removed. therefore, the heterogeneity did not come from the methodological heterogeneity. accordingly, there probably exists clinical heterogeneity. owing to the strict eligibility criteria, the patient data had a good homogeneity; thus, the heterogeneity was due to the ability of the surgeons. the subgroup analysis results regarding operation time are shown in ﬁgure 3. as for the fused segment height, clinical heterogeneity existed. oh et al9 and burkhardt et al14 have deﬁned the fused segment height as the distance between the mid- lines of the involved cranial vertebral bodies and the caudal vertebral bodies. in contrast, jia et al16 did not describe the method to measure the fused segment height. meanwhile, liu et al11 and kim et al17 reported the anterior and posterior heights of the involved verte- bral bodies. in summary, for the fused segment height, we pooled the data of oh et al9 and burkhardt et al,14 and the outcome is displayed in ﬁgure 6a. with regard to graft collapse, as the two literature examples are both retrospective studies, it is believed that no methodo- logical heterogeneity existed. regarding the clinical het- erogeneity, the patient data had a good homogeneity due to the strict eligibility criteria and the fact that the methods of measuring the graft collapse were the same. figure 6 radiological parameters.

as a result, no signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity or meth- odological heterogeneity was found. however, statistical heterogeneity most likely existed, so the studies were pooled. not all of the included studies had consistent baseline characteristics between the accf and acdf groups. therefore, larger randomised controlled trials of high quality are still needed in the future to compare the two surgeries. conclusion based on this meta-analysis that compared acdf and accf to treat two-adjacent-level csm, acdf has some advantages such as less blood loss, a shorter operation time, greater cervical lordosis in the total cervical and fused segments, a higher segmental height and less graft subsidence. however, no signiﬁcant differences in joa, vas, rom or complications were found. this informa- tion will provide surgeons a preliminary understanding of the differences between the two surgeries to treat two-adjacent-level csm and help clinical surgeons choose the right surgical method to treat patients with two-adjacent-level csm. further high-quality rcts and longer follow-up durations are needed to assess these two treatments. acknowledgements the authors thank medjaden bioscience for assisting in the preparation of this manuscript. contributors z-yh, a-mw and w-fn conceived and designed the review. z-yh, a-mw and w-fn performed the review. z-yh and a-mw analysed the data. q-ll, tl, k-yw and h-zx contributed reagents/materials/ analysis tools. z-yh and a-mw were involved in the writing of the manuscript. figure 7 (a) forest plot and tabulated data for fusion rate; (a) forest plot and tabulated data for degeneration of the adjacent level; (c) forest plot and tabulated data for complications. there was no significant difference in any of these parameters between the two types of surgery. 10 huang z-y, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e004581. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004581 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from
