admission sbp in a certain interval with optimal outcome. as the pathogenesis of acs is a complicated patho- physiological process accompanying intricate neuroendo- crine alterations,10 blood pressure level after myocardial infarction is a reﬂection of integrated cardiovascular system and neuroendocrine system. some previous studies11–16 have shown that elevated admission blood pressure is associated with increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with st-segment elevation myo- cardial infarction (stemi) following thrombolytic therapy; and elevated blood pressure during or after the procedure is an independent risk factor for minor bleed- ing and haematoma in patients who undergo percutan- eous coronary intervention (pci) and angiography.17 18 moreover, signiﬁcant hypertension on presentation (sbp >180 mm hg or diastolic blood pressure (dbp) >110 mm hg) is a relative contraindication for thromb- olysis in current guidelines for management of stemi.19 a risk–beneﬁt assessment may compromise the use of reperfusion strategies for those with elevated, especially excessively elevated, admission blood pressure in daily clinical practice. moreover, elevated systemic blood pres- sure results in increased myocardial oxygen consump- tion, worsening the imbalance between oxygen supply and myocardial metabolic demand, which goes against the prognosis. in addition, elevated blood pressure is associated with more severe complications such as cardiac rupture.20 therefore, we hypothesised that ele- vated admission sbp, especially excessively elevated sbp after acute myocardial infarction, was associated with a poor short-term outcome. to test this hypothesis, we ana- lysed retrospectively a large sample of patients with stemi from a prospectively designed multihospital data- base in china and evaluated the impact of elevated admission sbp on the short-term outcomes in patients with stemi. methods study population from july 2001 to july 2004, 7510 consecutive patients presenting with acute stemi within 12 h from the onset of symptoms in 247 hospitals in china were enrolled. stemi was deﬁned as: chest pain or equivalent symp- toms in combination with dynamic ecg changes consist- ent with stemi (in the presence of st elevation >0.1 mv in ≥2 extremity leads or >0.2 mv in ≥2 precor- dial leads, or accompanying with left bundle branch block morphology), and increased serum biochemical markers of cardiac necrosis, including creatine kinase-mb and troponin i. all participants provided their written informed consent. of the 7510 patients, 123 patients were excluded because of incomplete data. in addition, a total of 796 patients with admission sbp <100 mm hg were excluded because they belonged to a well-deﬁned group known to have a poor outcome according to previous studies.3 5 21 the remaining 6591 patients were divided into three groups according to admission sbp: normal sbp group (sbp 100–139 mm hg), modestly elevated sbp group (sbp 140–179 mm hg) and excessively elevated sbp group (sbp≥180 mm hg). procedural characteristics after admission, patients received therapy including aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, ace inhibitors or angio- tensin receptors blockers (arb), nitrates, β blockers, calcium channel blockers (ccb) and statins as far as possible to comply with the current guidelines for treat- ment of stemi. those who were suitable for reperfu- sion therapy were treated with thrombolysis or pci according to the clinical circumstances. demographic data and epidemiological variables were collected at admission. the baseline data included gender, age, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, cardiovascular histories (myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure), location of myo- cardial infarction and killip class, methods of reperfu- sion therapy, as well as drugs used during hospitalisation and follow-up. study end points and definitions the primary outcome measure was all-cause death within 7 and 30 days after myocardial infarction. the secondary outcomes included: (1) major adverse cardiac events (mace) that were composite of death, cardio- genic shock, recurrent myocardial ischaemia, myocardial reinfarction and stroke within 7 and 30 days after myo- cardial infarction; (2) bleeding events including major bleeding and minor bleeding within 7 and 30 days after myocardial infarction. the deﬁnition of different cardiac events was as fol- lowing: cardiogenic shock was deﬁned as persistent hypotension (sbp<90 mm hg) that did not respond to ﬂuid titration and required an intra-aortic balloon pump or intravenous inotropic therapy. recurrent myocardial ischaemia was deﬁned as recurrent chest pain with new ecg changes. reinfarction was deﬁned as recurrent typical chest pain with new ischaemic ecg changes (st re-elevation or depression, or new q waves) and a further increase in enzyme levels (to twice the upper limit of normal if it had returned to baseline or if already elevated, with a further elevation by 50%). stroke was deﬁned as focal neurological deﬁcits that per- sisted for more than 24 h and were conﬁrmed by ct scans or mri. bleeding was deﬁned according to the bleeding academic research consortium (barc) deﬁ- nitions22 as: type 1 is in which the patient does not seek treatment; type 2 is in which intervention or admission to hospital occurs; type 3a is overt bleeding plus haemo- globin drop of 3 to less than 5 g/dl or transfusion; type 3b is overt bleeding plus haemoglobin drop of at least 5 g/dl, cardiac tamponade, bleeding requiring surgical intervention or intravenous vasoactive agents; type 3c is intracranial haemorrhage or intraocular bleeding 2 huang b, yang y, zhu j, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005097. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005097 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


compromising vision; type 4 is coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding and type 5 is fatal bleeding. owing to limited availability of data and lack of data about coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding, we analysed the data of type 1, type 2, type 3 and type 5 bleeding. patients with elevated admission sbp were compared with those with normal admission sbp in terms of clin- ical characteristics and 7-day and 30-day outcomes. statistical analysis the baseline characteristics of patients were presented with mean±sd for continuous variables and compared by one-way analysis of variance, and with bonferroni cor- rection if the data were of normal distribution, otherwise wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. categorical variables presented as percentage were compared by pearson χ2 test. multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the factors associated with short-term bleeding events. cumulative survival and mace curves were con- structed using the kaplan-meier method. log-rank tests were used to compare the curves of groups. cox propor- tional hazard regression models were used to identify whether there was an association between different sbp levels on admission and prognosis and the models were corrected for age, sex, cardiovascular histories (myocar- dial infarction, hypertension, stroke and heart failure), heart rate, dbp, haemoglobin, blood sugar, killip class, location of myocardial infarction, reperfusion strategies and drugs used during hospitalisation mainly including anticoagulants, ace inhibitors (or arb), β blockers and ccb. the adjusted hrs with their respective 95% cis for each group were calculated with reference to the normal sbp group, for which the hr was considered as 1. all statistical tests were two-tailed, and p values were statistically signiﬁcant at <0.05. all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss statistical software, v.19.0 (spss inc., chicago, illinois, usa). results baseline characteristics of the 6591 patients included in this study, 4696 (71.2%) were men and 1895 (28.8%) were women, with a mean age of 60.13±12.11 and 68.05±9.10 years, respect- ively. when these patients were divided according to admission sbp, 4182 (63.5%) had normal admission sbp (100–139 mm hg), 2187 (33.2%) modestly elevated admission sbp (140–179 mm hg) and 222 (3.4%) exces- sively elevated admission sbp (≥180 mm hg). table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the three groups divided according to admission sbp. it was found that compared with patients with normal admission sbp, those with elevated admission sbp were more likely to be older, of female gender and tended to have more concomitant cardiovascular morbidities such as hyper- tension, heart failure and histories of stroke and myocar- dial infarction. this was true especially for patients with excessively elevated sbp; 77.9% of these patients had a history of hypertension, signiﬁcantly higher than that of patients with normal admission sbp (32.6%) or patients with modestly elevated admission sbp (57.4%; p<0.001). at admission, patients with excessively elevated sbp had a higher heart rate, haemoglobin, blood sugar, as well as a higher percentage of patients with killip class >1 com- pared with patients with normal sbp. also, a higher pro- portion of anterior wall myocardial infarction was found in patients with elevated admission sbp. however, reper- fusion treatment including thrombolysis and pci were less frequently administered to patients with elevated admission sbp, especially those with excessively elevated sbp. in addition, anticoagulants were used less fre- quently in patients with elevated sbp, whereas antiplate- let therapy was comparable among the three groups. moreover, patients with elevated sbp were more likely to be treated with β blockers, acei (or arb) and ccb compared with patients with normal sbp (table 2). seven-day and 30-day outcomes figure 1 shows the 7-day and 30-day outcomes. the 7-day all-cause mortality was 6.5% in normal admission sbp group compared with 6.1% in modestly elevated sbp group and 6.3% in excessively elevated sbp group (p=0.842). mace rates within 7 days were 18.1%, 16.8% and 18.9%, respectively, with no statistical difference between the groups (p=0.400). in addition, incidences of bleeding within 7 days were also comparable between the groups (3.5% in normal admission sbp group, 3.7% in modestly elevated admission sbp group and 3.6% in excessively elevated admission sbp group, p=0.889). although the 30-day all-cause mortality in excessively elevated admission sbp group (11.3%) was higher than the other two groups (8.8% in normal admission sbp group and 8.5% in modestly elevated admission sbp group, respectively), it did not reach statistical difference (p=0.370). similarly, mace and bleeding rates for the three groups were comparable (p=0.369 and 0.886, respectively). table 3 shows the incidence of 7-day and 30-day bleed- ing events according to the barc deﬁnition stratiﬁed by admission sbp. the incidences of type 1, type 2, type 3 as well as type 5 within 7 days were similar between the groups (p=0.979). the 30-day values for the groups were also comparable (p=0.523). table 4 displays the factors associated with 30-day bleeding events by logistic regression analysis. it was found that advanced age, low weight, thrombolysis, pci treatment and aspirin use were independent risk factors predicting short-term bleeding events, while elevated admission sbp was not associated with increased risk of short-term bleeding compared with normal admission sbp (or=1.108, 95% ci 0.677 to 1.816, p=0.683 for modestly elevated admission sbp and or=2.119, 95% ci 0.746 to 6.013, p=0.158 for excessively elevated admis- sion sbp, respectively). huang b, yang y, zhu j, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005097. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005097 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


kaplan-meier curves for 30-day mortality are shown in ﬁgure 2. the log-rank test reported that there was no sig- niﬁcant difference between the three groups (p=0.377). similarly, curves of mace within 30 days showed no stat- istical difference between the three groups (p=0.375; ﬁgure 3). cox analysis showed that after adjusting variables that inﬂuenced the prognosis of stemi, neither modestly elevated admission sbp nor excessively elevated admis- sion sbp were associated with increased risk of 7-day all- cause mortality (hr=0.905, 95% ci 0.698 to 1.175, p=0.454 for modestly elevated sbp, and hr=0.766, 95% ci 0.408 to 1.440, p=0.408 for excessively elevated sbp, respectively) and 30-day all-cause mortality (hr=0.850, 95% ci 0.681 to 1.060, p=0.148 for modestly elevated sbp and hr=0.920, 95% ci 0.566 to 1.495, p=0.737 for excessively elevated sbp, respectively) compared with normal admission sbp. similarly, no increased risk of 7-day and 30-day mace was found in modestly elevated admission sbp (hr=0.926, 95% ci 0.793 to 1.018, p=0.328 for 7-day mace and hr=0.906, 95% ci 0.783 to 1.047, p=0.182 for 30-day mace, respectively) and table 1 baseline characteristics of patients according to the admission sbp (mm hg) variable normal sbp (100–139) (n=4182) modestly elevated sbp (140–179) (n=2187) excessively elevated sbp (≥180) (n=222) p value demographics age (years) 61.82±11.97 63.53±11.68 63.94±10.23 <0.001 male (n (%)) 3070 (73.4) 1492 (68.2) 134 (60.4) <0.001 weight (kg) 66.93±11.52 67.50±12.07 67.63±11.93 0.304 cardiovascular disease histories previous mi (n (%)) 362 (8.7) 142 (6.5) 22 (9.9) 0.006 previous dm (n (%)) 461 (11.0) 251 (11.5) 33 (14.9) 0.202 previous htn (n (%)) 1362 (32.6) 1256 (57.4) 173 (77.9) <0.001 previous stroke (n (%)) 341 (8.2) 236 (10.8) 37 (16.7) <0.001 previous hf (n (%)) 105 (2.5) 59 (2.7) 13 (5.9) 0.011 admission vital signs and laboratory examination heart rate (bpm) 76.40±17.38 80.05±17.30 85.33±18.65 <0.001 sbp (mm hg) 118.03±10.90 151.36±10.32 188.73±13.99 <0.001 dbp (mm hg) 75.21±10.12 91.73±11.91 106.47±16.24 <0.001 hb (g/l) 135.66±20.43 136.13±21.36 139.82±22.26 0.013 blood sugar (mmolll/l) 8.34±4.04 8.54±4.12 9.09±4.59 0.008 killip class >1 (n (%)) 640 (15.3) 362 (16.6) 55 (24.8) 0.001 st segment elevation on ecg v1–v6 (n (%)) 2221 (53.1) 1253 (57.3) 140 (63.1) <0.001 ii, iii, avf or v7–v9 (n (%)) 1888 (45.1) 880 (40.2) 73 (32.9) <0.001 i, avl (n (%)) 73 (1.7) 54 (2.5) 9 (4.1) <0.001 dbp, diastolic blood pressure; dm, diabetes mellitus; hb, haemoglobin; hf, heart failure; htn, hypertension; mi, myocardial infarction; sbp, systolic blood pressure. table 2 treatment characteristics of patients according to the admission sbp (mm hg) variable normal sbp (100–139) (n=4182) modestly elevated sbp (140–179) (n=2187) excessively elevated sbp (≥180) (n=222) p value reperfusion strategies thrombolysis (n (%)) 2252 (53.8) 1101 (50.3) 96 (43.2) 0.001 pci (n (%)) 517 (12.4) 241 (11.0) 15 (6.8) 0.018 anticoagulants heparin (or lmwh) (n (%)) 3881 (92.8) 1981 (90.6) 197 (88.7) 0.035 antiplatelet therapy aspirin (n (%)) 4028 (96.3) 2107 (96.3) 210 (94.6) 0.408 clopidogrel (n (%)) 1205 (28.8) 605 (27.7) 55 (24.8) 0.310 other medications β blocker (n (%)) 2591 (62.0) 1485 (67.9) 152 (68.5) <0.001 acei (or arb) (n (%)) 2965 (70.9) 1790 (81.8) 194 (87.4) <0.001 statins (n (%)) 2999 (71.7) 1621 (74.1) 163 (73.4) 0.118 ccb (n (%)) 499 (11.9) 329 (15.0) 50 (22.5) <0.001 acei, ace inhibitors; arb, angiotensin receptors blockers; ccb, calcium channel blocker; lmwh, low molecular weight heparin; pci, percutaneous coronary intervention; sbp, systolic blood pressure. 4 huang b, yang y, zhu j, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005097. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005097 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from

there was an inverse association between admission sbp and 1-year mortality. however, a study of acute myocardial infarction from japan reported that admission sbp 141–159 mm hg was correlated with a better inhospital prognosis, whereas admission sbp ≥160 mm hg was not optimal and led to an increased incidence of cardiac rupture which might contribute in part to a relatively higher inhospital mortality.8 likewise, in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing pci, similar conclusions were reached.9 our results showed that those with elevated admission sbp after stemi had a high-risk proﬁle. they were more likely to be older, with a higher proportion of female gender and more likely to have concomitant car- diovascular morbidities. meanwhile, higher heart rate, blood sugar and killip class >1 at admission were found among these patients. in addition, more events of anter- ior myocardial infarction, less reperfusion treatment and anticoagulation therapy characterised these patients. the aforementioned characteristics were indicators of poor prognosis stratiﬁed by current guidelines and risk scores. however, they had comparable short-term mor- tality, incidence of mace and bleeding, as well as risks related with short-term mortality and mace after multi- variate adjusting compared with those with normal admission sbp. it is noteworthy that several studies11 12 14 15 have reported that elevated admission sbp was associated with increased risk of bleeding events, especially when sbp exceeded 175 mm hg. in contrast, our study showed that patients with excessively elevated sbp had similar incidence of bleeding com- pared with those with normal admission sbp. besides, elevated admission sbp was not yet a risk factor for bleeding in multivariate logistic analysis. we inferred that ethnic heterogeneity and disparity in thrombolytic drugs used might account for the inconsistent conclusions. in our study, it was found that the percentage of patients who received reperfusion treatment was low and was signiﬁcantly different between the groups. some possible interpretation should be inferred. this was a multicentre registry study and the medical institutions included in this study covered different levels of medical care (academic and non-academic, general and specia- lised, urban and rural). disequilibrium of healthcare resulted in distinct treatment in these medical institu- tions, which led to a relatively low application of reperfu- sion in our study. moreover, the decision to use reperfusion therapy was based on the evaluation that integrated the clinical features at presentation, patient comorbidities and use of medical resources as well as risk–beneﬁt analysis, which disposed patients with stemi with elevated admission sbp to receive less reper- fusion treatment. also, the standard medication therapy was inadequate such as relatively lower use of clopido- grel, β blockers and statins in our study. this was a real- world study and also reﬂected the huge gulf between clinical guidelines and real-world practice, and an improved condition was anticipated. furthermore, we used multivariate cox regression analysis to eliminate, to some extent, the effect of imbalance of baseline characteristics on the outcome. however, after multivari- ate adjustment, elevated admission sbp was not asso- ciated with increased risk of poor short-term outcome. the reason why those with elevated sbp despite having a higher risk at baseline, were not associated with a worse short-term outcome remains unclear. however, several possibilities might account for this phenomenon. figure 3 the curves for cumulative mace stratified by admission sbp. mace, major adverse cardiac events; sbp, systolic blood pressure. figure 2 the kaplan-meier curves for survival stratified by admission sbp. sbp, systolic blood pressure. 6 huang b, yang y, zhu j, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e005097. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005097 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


first, as aforementioned, blood pressure level after myo- cardial infarction is determined by integrated cardiovas- cular system and neuroendocrine system. higher admission blood pressure is a marker of preserved cardiac function due to a relatively small infarction area and a positive and effective response to stress. in fact, observational studies in acute heart failure also found that admission sbp was inversely associated with the short-term outcome.26–28 therefore, studies from acute myocardial infarction and acute heart failure suggested that elevated blood pressure, in a pronounced stressful situation, was not always harmful, to the contrary, was a symbol of compensation function in good condition. second, patients with excessively elevated admission sbp in our study had a high prevalence of hypertension (77.9%). the antihypertension drugs they usually took, such as acei and β blockers, were cardioprotective. moreover, these medications were maintained after myo- cardial infarction, also helpful in improving outcomes by mechanisms of reducing myocardial oxygen consump- tion, suppressing remoulding and reducing the risk of sudden death. similarly, in abrignani et al’s report,29 it was found that patients with hypertension with ﬁrst acute myocardial infarction had a better inhospital outcome than that of normotensive patients. it was pro- posed that a less severe extension of infarction area, higher coronary perfusion from elevated dbp as well as abundant collateral circulation formation in patients with hypertension contributed to a better short-term outcome. however, as far as the impact of hypertension on the short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with stemi is concerned, studies reached inconsistent conclusion. in the thrombolytic era, some studies30 31 found hypertension adversely affected the short-term and long-term outcomes, while others32 33 found no dif- ference in patients with and without hypertension. in the era of mechanical revascularisation, several recent studies have evaluated the impact of hypertension on the short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with stemi and reported similar conclusion. in rembek et al’s report,34 no difference was observed in inhospital mortality between hypertensive and normotensive patients. parodi et al35 found the 5-year mortality in patients with and without hypertension was comparable; however, patients with hypertension were at a higher risk of developing heart failure after stemi. lazzeri et al36 assessed the inﬂuence of hypertension on the short-term and long-term outcome in 560 patients with stemi sub- mitted to mechanical revascularisation and found that a history of hypertension had no affect on either short- term or long-term mortality. similar results were also found in cecchi et al’s report.37 the reason why hyper- tension has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcome in patients with stemi who undergo pci may be multifac- torial. one possible interpretation is that patients with hypertensive stemi did not show a larger infarct size compared with normotensive patients, depicted by de luca g et al’s study.38 another possible explanation was the altered lifestyle and standard antihypertensive therapy after stemi which controlled the main cardio- vascular risk factors and resulted in a relatively fair outcome.37 however, although hypertension appeared to have no impact on the outcome in patients with stemi who underwent pci, patients with hypertension showed an altered glucose response to stress, as indi- cated by a higher incidence of acute insulin resistance and higher admission glucose values, which has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for 1-year mortality in patients with stemi who underwent pci with estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate ≥60 ml/min/m2.39 our study also showed that patients with elevated admission sbp presented with higher admission blood sugar and after multivariate adjustment, higher admission blood sugar was an independent risk factor for short-term mortality (data not shown). in addition, in our study, the reperfu- sion treatment was mainly by means of thrombolysis, but comparisons of the effect of thrombolysis on the groups were lacking. whether those with excessively elevated admission sbp beneﬁted more from thrombolysis after lowering the blood pressure to a level appropriate for thrombolysis deserved further study. it is noteworthy that although short-term outcomes were similar between patients with normal and elevated admission sbp, it was shown from the survival and mace curves that patients with excessively elevated admission sbp had a trend towards increased mortality and incidence of mace as time went on. therefore, the impact of elevated admission sbp, especially for those table 5 adjusted hrs according to the admission sbp (mm hg) normal sbp (100–139) modestly elevated sbp (140–179) excessively elevated sbp (≥180) hr hr (95% ci) p value hr (95% ci) p value all-cause mortality within 7 days 1 (reference) 0.905 (0.698 to 1.175) 0.454 0.766 (0.408 to 1.440) 0.408 within 30 days 1 (reference) 0.850 (0.681 to 1.060) 0.148 0.920 (0.566 to 1.495) 0.737 mace within 7 days 1 (reference) 0.926 (0.793 to 1.018) 0.328 0.918 (0.640 to 1.318) 0.644 within 30 days 1 (reference) 0.906 (0.783 to 1.047) 0.182 0.936 (0.673 to 1.303) 0.696 mace, major adverse cardiac events;

with excessively elevated admission sbp, on the long- term outcome needed to be studied by follow-up. there are some limitations of our study. first, it is a retrospective observational study and causal relationship cannot be inferred. owing to the insufﬁciency of guide- line implementation, our results may not be generalis- able to patients with stemi undergoing reperfusion therapy and standard medications. therefore, prospect- ive studies with standard therapy are needed to conﬁrm our results. second, data about sbp were collected at admission only, whereas detailed treatment and blood pressure control levels during hospitalisation and after discharge that might relate to the prognosis were not available. third, due to the retrospective study design, other data such as left ventricular mass, left ventricular ejection fraction, severity of the residual stenosis of the infarct-related coronary artery and biomarkers of myo- cardial necrosis that were valuable parameters for evalu- ating prognosis were lacking. in addition, the number of patients with excessively elevated admission sbp was rela- tively small and might limit the statistical power. finally, the follow-up time in our study was short-term and a long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of elevated admission sbp in patients with stemi. conclusion although those with elevated admission sbp after stemi were at high risk for cardiovascular events, they did not experience poorer short-term outcomes com- pared with those with normal admission sbp. acknowledgements the
