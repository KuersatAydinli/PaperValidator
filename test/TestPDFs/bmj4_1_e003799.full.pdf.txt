iodine, not the intake on any 1 day, that determines iodine status of groups. consequently, a method to reduce or remove the effects of the measurement error due to the intraindividual variation that results from collecting a single-spot urine sample from each survey participant would allow a greater description of the population status. several methods exist to correct for intraindividual variation in population survey data. one method is to collect multiple days of data on each survey participant and average the data for each participant. this has sub- stantial logistical costs when conducting a national survey. another method is to apply a correction factor to the distribution.8 9 this requires estimating the correc- tion factor, for example, by collecting multiple samples from a representative subset of the survey population. this second method has been applied many times to dietary intake data10–12 but has been applied less fre- quently to biochemical data.13–15 in a survey of indigen- ous australian adolescents with muic of 51 µg/l, correcting the distribution based on two urine samples per person reduced the 95th centile from 129 to 92 µg/l13 14 have highlighted the widespread misuse of cal- culating the proportions of uic below the cut-off level of 100 µg/l to estimate the prevalence of iodine deﬁ- ciency. this will overestimate or underestimate the pro- portion with deﬁciency depending on the location of the median. in the previous example,13 the raw data would be misinterpreted as showing that 90% were <100 µg/l, whereas this was 97% after correction for within-person variation. in clearly deﬁcient populations, this difference is not important for programme plan- ning. however, as a population approaches sufﬁciency, accurate estimation becomes more important for reﬁn- ing programmes. similarly in replete populations, an accurate estimate of the high intake is needed to assess whether part of the population is reaching potentially adverse levels. remote indigenous people have a different lifestyle from that of urbanised non-indigenous australians. in this study, we investigate the intraindividual variation in uic in older non-indigenous australians, living in an urban iodine-deﬁcient area prior to the introduction of mandatory fortiﬁcation. we extend previous work by examining the impact of having two versus three samples for calculating the correction factor and compare this with the effect of averaging the results for each person. methods participants and recruitment between may and september 2009, 110 adults aged 60– 95 years volunteered for a study that investigated the association between iodine status and cognition. english-speaking men and women were recruited from a random selection of aged care facilities (independent, assisted and low care living) in the illawarra region, south of sydney in australia. of the 110 participants, 84 participants (25 men) met the study inclusion criteria and were enrolled. twenty-six participants were excluded due to: (1) diagnosed dementia and/or alzheimer’s disease, (2) cognitive decline as indicated by a mini-mental state examination (mmse score of ≤23,16 (3) a previous stroke, (4) current use of thyroxine or any other medications that may affect memory, (5) uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure (bp) ≥160/ 95 mm hg) and (6) uncontrolled diabetes (blood glucose (bg) ≥7.8 mmol/l). the study protocol was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of wollongong and all participants pro- vided written informed consent. weight (tanita scale, tbg622, tanita inc, tokyo, japan) and height (stadiometer) of the participants were measured. body mass index was calculated as the ratio of weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). nutritional status was assessed using the 18-item mini nutritional assessment (mna) which has been previ- ously validated in older adults and classiﬁed according to categories of well nourished, at-risk or malnour- ished.17 the barthel index18 was administered to assess the ability to perform activities of daily living, with a score of >50/100 indicating independence. biochemical data participants were provided with written instructions for spot urine sample collections, which included collection of the ﬁrst voiding of the day, on the same day each week, where possible, over a 3-week period. urine samples were stored at −80°c and batch-analysed by the accredited laboratory of the institute of clinical pathology and medical research (icpmr), westmead hospital (sydney, new south wales, australia). uic was analysed using an adaptation of the sandell-kolthoff method using an ammonium persulfate digestion and microplate reading.19 the coefﬁcient of variation (cv) of the urinary iodine assay in the icpmr laboratory is 16.7% at 46±7.72 µg/l, 5.8% at 153±8.9 µg/l and 8.65% at 347±30 µg/l. the group muic was compared with population-speciﬁc reference values.2 statistical analyses the uic data were transformed using the natural loga- rithm to improve normality. repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to determine the between- person (sb) and total (sobs) sds. an adjusted log uic value was calculated for each person as20: adjusted uic=((person’s day 1 uic−group mean for day 1) × (sb/sobs)) + group mean for day 1 (equation 1). the results were exponentiated. the adjustment pro- cedure was performed twice using sas (v.9.2, sas cary, north carolina, usa). first, the correction factor (sb/ sobs) was calculated using all three replicates, then it was calculated using only the ﬁrst two replicates. we also calculated the average for each person using all three replicates and for the ﬁrst two replicates. centiles of the distribution and the proportion below selected values were calculated for the raw day 1 data and for 2 charlton ke, batterham mj, buchanan lm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e003799.

distributions derived using adjustment or averaging. descriptive analyses were performed using ibm spss (v.19.0 ibm corporation, armonk new york, usa). results sociodemographic characteristics of the study partici- pants are shown in table 1. all except 4 (5%) were classi- ﬁed as being well nourished according to the mna classiﬁcation, with the remainder in the ‘at-risk’ cat- egory. all the participants were independently able to perform activities of daily living. muic of the study population using the ﬁrst spot urine collection indicated mild iodine deﬁciency (65.5 (iqr 42–89)) μg/l). correlations for transformed urinary iodine concentration values were: days 1 and 2: r=0.48, p<0.01; days 1 and 3: r=0.43, p<0.01; days 2 and 3: r=0.41, p<0.01. the distribution of urinary iodine concentrations calculated by the different methods is shown in table 2 and ﬁgure 1. the sb/sobs was 0.83 when calculated using three replicates and 0.79 when calculated using two repli- cates; that is, the contraction in the distribution was slightly less with two replicates than three. compared with the raw distribution, adjustment and averaging reduced the spread of the distribution, especially at the upper end owing to the right skew in the data. following adjustment using the three urine collections, the muic remained unchanged but the iqr was shifted upwards 65.2 (55–94) while the upper end of the distribution (95th centile) changed from 176 to 136 μg/l. the per- centage of participants with uic <100 μg/l increased from 79% to 83% following adjustment. taking an average of the three replicates also yielded similar results to taking an average of only two replicates. the averaging method contracted the distribution less than the adjustment method and, in particular, had less effect in drawing the upper tail towards the median. discussion in this population with a suboptimal iodine status, the collection of a single urine sample from each participant would lead to different conclusions about the extremes of the population distribution of uic. this has also been shown previously in indigenous australian adoles- cents13 and young swiss women.14 in our population, there was no gain in having three, rather than two, samples as both adjustment factors were approximately 0.8 on the natural logarithmic scale. this means that the sd of the ﬁnal distribution is 80% of the original. the lower the ratio, the higher the correction —for example, a ratio of 0.5 would have resulted in a distribution with a sd of half the width of the original.21 we do not know whether having a greater number of replicates, such as 7 or 14, or including different seasons, would have yielded the same result. our urinary ﬁndings are consistent with the low variability in dietary iodine intake assessed at the same time in this popula- tion living in low-level residential aged care facilities.22 a similar adjustment ratio of 0.69 on the natural logarith- mic scale for uic has been reported in indigenous ado- lescents from the darwin area, whose dietary patterns are limited in variety.13 we hypothesise that the degree of adjustment would be larger in other populations that have more variety in food intake. heterogeneity in the iodine content of different foods and their frequency of consumption in different popula- tions will affect the magnitude of intraindividual variabil- ity in uic. this suggests that the intraindividual variability in uic would change after a fortiﬁcation table 1 demographic and clinical characteristics of the study particpants (n=84) characteristics subjects (n (%)) sex (%) men 25 (30%) women 59 (70%) age (years) 74±8* bmi† mean 28.4±4.7* underweight (<18.5 kg/m2) 0 (0%) normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2) 16 (19%) overweight (≥25 kg/m2) 45 (54%) obese (≥30 kg/m2) 23 (27%) education level ≤year 12 39 (47%) >year 12 44 (52%) unknown 1 (1%) *mean±sd. †calculated as kg/m2. table 2 urinary iodine concentration distribution, raw data from 1 day, after adjustment for intraindividual variation of two and three spot sample collections and averages of multiple collections centile urinary iodine concentration distributions (µg/l) raw data for day 1 average of days 1 and 2 day 1 corrected using 2 replicates average of days 1, 2 and 3 day 1 corrected using 3 replicates 5th 32.25 29.7 35.9 31.3 40.0 10th 35.50 35.5 40.8 38.3 43.0 25th 42.25 48.6 52.1 55.2 55.4 50th 65.5 65.5 66.8 69.0 65.2 75th 89.5 99.1 90.0 98.9 94.3 charlton ke, batterham mj, buchanan lm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e003799. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003799 3 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


programme is introduced. it could be further hypothe- sised that the intraindividual variability might increase if one or a small number of foods are fortiﬁed, particularly at high concentrations. in tasmania, the iqr widened as the muic value increased following iodisation of salt (25–65 g iodine/kg salt) used in bread. prefortiﬁcation, muic in schoolchildren was 73 (iqr 56–100) μg/l, which increased to 108 (73–158) μg/l following volun- tary fortiﬁcation and to 132 (96–198) μg/l postmanda- tory fortiﬁcation.23 however, it is not possible to compare these results to studies which report other para- meters for the uic distribution such as the range14 or the 10–90th centiles.24 it is less clear whether variability would increase or decrease if a wide range of foods are fortiﬁed and/or at a lower concentration. we hypothe- sise that adjustment factors need to be reassessed if iodine intake changes and multiple factors might be needed if there is a geographical variation in iodine status within a country. the greater narrowing in population distribution that results from the adjustment method, compared with the averaging method, is expected if multiple days are needed to estimate the long-term uic for an individual. this is because the average of few days of urinary collec- tion would still contain intraindividual variation. however, studies that collect a greater number of repli- cate samples than in the current study are still needed to compare the distribution determined by statistical adjustment to a directly assessed long-term average uic. another consideration is the use of spot urine samples as a proxy for assessment of iodine status at a population level. a spot sample does not reﬂect the intake over an entire day for which a 24 h collection would be needed. konig et al25 have reported a trend for higher intraindivi- dual variation for spot uic (38%) versus measured 24 h urinary iodine excretion (32%). our study sample comprised older adults, an age group which has been studied least for iodine status, and who also often have impaired renal function. we have previously suggested that spot urinary iodine concentra- tions may be underestimating 24 h excretion in this study population22 but this would not impact on intraindividual variability of uic which is the topic of the current article. any variation in day-to-day ﬂuid intake would be included in the changing uic for each person in the study on each day of collection. however, as the samples were all collected within a 3-week period, we have not included any variation in ﬂuid intake related to seasons. this may have underestimated the degree of adjustment in this population. however, a reduction in total ﬂuid intake, and therefore urine volume, might or might not affect the day-to-day variation. in our study, we had replicate samples on all partici- pants. a more logistically feasible alternative in a large survey is to collect the replicates in a representative subset and apply the adjustment factor calculated in the subset to the whole population. it may be necessary to subdivide the population, for example, by age and sex, and ensure that there are enough participants in each subdivision to permit a suitable range of adjustment factors to be calculated. the method we have used20 is the simplest of several methods that have a similar purpose.26 the disadvantage of collecting replicates in a subset only is that, although an estimate of the usual uic distribution of the population is obtained, the method treats each individual as representative of a larger group and so the value calculated for each indi- vidual in equation 1 is theoretical. therefore, if it is desired to link the intake with excretion at an individual level, then replicate information about intake and excre- tion for each survey participant would be preferable but it is also possible to correct a regression coefﬁcient for within-person variability.27 in addition, the method we used assumes that the data can be normalised. if this is not true, then alternatives include calculating an average for each participant28 or using a complex method such as the national cancer institute method.29 conclusion in a sample of healthy older australian adults who were iodine deplete, the use of two or three spot urine samples for adjustment of intraindividual variation in urinary iodine concentration resulted in a narrowed population distribution, particularly at the upper end. statistical adjustment yielded a stronger correction than averaging the replicates. there was no important gain in collecting a third sample in this population; however, this ﬁnding might be speciﬁc to our group and not gen- eralisable to other age groups. the impact of the adjust- ment in narrowing the distribution would be greater in figure 1 population distribution of urinary iodine, according to number of days of spot urine collection. 4 charlton ke, batterham mj, buchanan lm, et al. bmj open 2014;4:e003799. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003799 open access group.bmj.com on august 14, 2015 - published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/downloaded from 


groups with more varied dietary intakes, and therefore wider intraindividual variation in uic. these results provide a case for further work to investigate the useful- ness of determining adjustment
