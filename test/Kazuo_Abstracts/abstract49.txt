 Phase III intergroup study of talc poudrage vs talc slurry sclerosis for malignant pleural effusion .
 To demonstrate the efficacy , safety , and appropriate mode of instillation of talc for sclerosis in treatment of malignant pleural effusions ( MPEs ) .
 A prospective , randomized trial was designed to compare thoracoscopy with talc insufflation ( TTI ) to thoracostomy and talc slurry ( TS ) for patients with documented MPE .
 The primary end point was 30-day freedom from radiographic MPE recurrence among surviving patients whose lungs initially re-expanded > 90 % .
 Morbidity , mortality , and quality of life were also assessed .
 Of 501 patients registered , those eligible were randomized to TTI ( n = 242 ) or TS ( n = 240 ) .
 Patient demographics and primary malignancies were similar between study arms .
 Overall , there was no difference between study arms in the percentage of patients with successful 30-day outcomes ( TTI , 78 % ; TS , 71 % ) .
 However , the subgroup of patients with primary lung or breast cancer had higher success with TTI than with TS ( 82 % vs 67 % ) .
 Common morbidity included fever , dyspnea , and pain .
 Treatment-related mortality occurred in nine TTI patients and seven TS patients .
 Respiratory complications were more common following TTI than TS ( 14 % vs 6 % ) .
 Respiratory failure was observed in 4 % of TS patients and 8 % of TTI patients , accounting for five toxic deaths and six toxic deaths , respectively .
 Quality-of-life measurement demonstrated less fatigue with TTI than TS .
 Patient ratings of comfort and safety were also higher for TTI , but there were no differences on perceived value or convenience of the procedures .
 Both methods of talc delivery are similar in efficacy ; TTI may be better for patients with either a lung or breast primary .
 The etiology and incidence of respiratory complications from talc need further exploration .
