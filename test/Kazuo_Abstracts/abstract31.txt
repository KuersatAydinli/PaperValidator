 Randomized phase III trial of dose-dense chemotherapy supported by whole-blood hematopoietic progenitors in better-prognosis small-cell lung cancer .
 Recent dose-intensity studies of small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) have yielded conflicting results .
 We carried out a phase III randomized trial in patients with better-prognosis SCLC ( i.e. , prognostic score of 0-1 ) to investigate whether doubling the dose density of ifosfamide , carboplatin , and etoposide ( ICE ) chemotherapy with filgrastim and blood-progenitor-cell support improves survival , compared with standard ICE chemotherapy .
 We studied 318 patients with pathologically proven SCLC who were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of ICE chemotherapy with a 4-week ( standard arm ) or 2-week ( dose-dense arm ) interval between cycles .
 Patients in the dose-dense arm received filgrastim subcutaneously daily on days 4 through 14 and had autologous blood collected before cycles 2 through 6 , which was returned 24 hours after treatment .
 Toxicities , including hematologic toxicity and incidence of neutropenic sepsis , were monitored .
 Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method .
 All statistical tests were two-sided .
 The delivered median dose intensity was 99 % ( interquartile range = 96%-100 % ) for the standard arm and 182 % ( interquartile range = 163%-196 % ) for the dose-dense arm .
 After a median follow-up of 14 months , overall response to treatment was observed in 118 ( 80 % ) of the 148 evaluable patients in the standard arm and in 129 ( 88 % ) of the 147 evaluable patients in the dose-dense arm , a statistically non-significant difference .
 Median overall survival was 13.9 months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 12.9 to 15.8 months ) in the standard arm and 14.4 months ( 95 % CI = 12.7 to 16.0 ) in the dose-dense arm , and the 2-year survival was 22 % ( 95 % CI = 16 % to 29 % ) and 19 % ( 95 % CI = 14 % to 27 % ) , respectively--neither difference being statistically significant .
 The median treatment free time was 286 days ( 95 % CI = 229 to 343 days ) for the standard arm and 367 days ( 95 % CI = 321 to 413 days ) for the dose-dense arm ( difference = 81 days ; P = .109 ) .
 Statistically significantly more hematologic toxicity was reported in the dose-dense arm than in the standard arm , but the number of cycles complicated by neutropenic sepsis was statistically significantly higher in the standard arm than in the dose-dense arm ( 15.3 % versus 11.6 % , respectively ; difference = 3.7 % , 95 % CI = -4.1 % to 11.5 % ; P = .03 ) .
 Dose-dense ICE chemotherapy for SCLC led to shorter treatment duration and less neutropenic sepsis than did standard ICE but did not improve overall survival .
