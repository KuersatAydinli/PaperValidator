 Chemoradiation with and without surgery in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus .
 Combined chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery are widely accepted alternatives for the curative treatment of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer .
 The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown .
 Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy ( 40 Gy ) followed by surgery ( arm A ) , or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy ( at least 65 Gy ) without surgery ( arm B ) .
 Primary outcome was overall survival time .
 The median observation time was 6 years .
 The analysis of 172 eligible , randomized patients ( 86 patients per arm ) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups ( log-rank test for equivalence , P < .05 ) .
 Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group ( 2-year progression-free survival , 64.3 % ; 95 % CI , 52.1 % to 76.5 % ) than in the chemoradiotherapy group ( 2-year progression-free survival , 40.7 % ; 95 % CI , 28.9 % to 52.5 % ; hazard ratio [ HR ] for arm B v arm A , 2.1 ; 95 % CI , 1.3 to 3.5 ; P = .003 ) .
 Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group ( 12.8 % v 3.5 % , respectively ; P = .03 ) .
 Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( HR , 0.30 ; 95 % CI , 0.19 to 0.47 ; P < .0001 ) .
 Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC .
 Tumor response to induction chemotherapy identifies a favorable prognostic group within these high-risk patients , regardless of the treatment group .
