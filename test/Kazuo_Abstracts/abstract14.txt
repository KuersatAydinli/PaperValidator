 Erlotinib in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer .
 We conducted a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial to determine whether the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib prolongs survival in non-small-cell lung cancer after the failure of first-line or second-line chemotherapy .
 Patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer , with performance status from 0 to 3 , were eligible if they had received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens .
 The patients were stratified according to center , performance status , response to prior chemotherapy , number of prior regimens , and prior platinum-based therapy and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib , at a dose of 150 mg daily , or placebo .
 The median age of the 731 patients who underwent randomization was 61.4 years ; 49 percent had received two prior chemotherapy regimens , and 93 percent had received platinum-based chemotherapy .
 The response rate was 8.9 percent in the erlotinib group and less than 1 percent in the placebo group ( P<0.001 ) ; the median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 months , respectively .
 Progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.8 months , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.61 , adjusted for stratification categories ; P<0.001 ) .
 Overall survival was 6.7 months and 4.7 months , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.70 ; P<0.001 ) , in favor of erlotinib .
 Five percent of patients discontinued erlotinib because of toxic effects .
 Erlotinib can prolong survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer after first-line or second-line chemotherapy .
