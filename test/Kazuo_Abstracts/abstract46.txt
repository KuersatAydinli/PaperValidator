 Survival benefit for patients with advanced-stage transitional cell carcinomas vs. other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma after chemotherapy with platinum and paclitaxel .
 Transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) of the ovary is a less well recognized histological type of ovarian carcinoma resembling TCC of the urinary bladder .
 A better prognosis due to a better chemosensitivity of ovarian TCC has been suggested .
 It was the aim of the present retrospective study to compare incidence and outcome of patients with TCCs and other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma from a large homogeneous collective of patients with primary advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma .
 H and E-stained sections from a total of 302 cases from a prospective randomized , multi-center , phase III study of patients with ovarian cancer , FIGO-stages IIB-IV , comparing cisplatin plus paclitaxel ( PT ) with paclitaxel plus carboplatin ( TC ) were available for histological retyping of ovarian carcinomas applying current WHO criteria .
 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed .
 16 of 302 tumors ( 5.3 % ) were diagnosed as TCC .
 Only 1 of the 16 TCCs had been previously diagnosed as such by referring pathologists .
 TCCs were associated with smaller preoperative extraovarian tumor and with smaller postoperative residual tumor .
 5-year survival of patients with TCC was 57 % as compared to 31 % for patients with ovarian carcinomas of other types ( P = 0.03 ) .
 TCC of the ovary seems to be a less well recognized entity .
 In the current series , TCCs had a significantly better prognosis as compared to all other types of ovarian carcinomas after standardized chemotherapy .
 A propensity for micronodular rather than macronodular extraovarian spread and better surgical resectability of TCC might contribute to the survival benefit .
