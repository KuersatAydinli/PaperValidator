 Phase III study of 5FU , etoposide and leucovorin ( FELV ) compared to epirubicin , cisplatin and 5FU ( ECF ) in previously untreated patients with advanced biliary cancer .
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether epirubicin , cisplatin and infused 5FU ( ECF ) improves overall survival ( OS ) compared to 5FU , etoposide and leucovorin ( FELV ) in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary cancer in a prospective randomised study .
 Patients were randomly assigned to receive epirubicin , cisplatin and infused 5FU ECF or bolus 5FU etoposide and leucovorin ( FELV ) .
 The primary end point was OS with secondary end points of objective response rate ( ORR ) , failure-free survival ( FFS ) , quality of life ( QOL ) and toxicity .
 In all , 54 patients were recruited with 27 randomly assigned to each arm .
 The median OS for ECF was 9.02 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 6.46-11.51 ) and FELV 12.03 months ( 95 % CI : 9.3-14.7 ) , P=0.2059 .
 Objective response rates were similar for both arms : ECF 19.2 % ( 95 % CI : 6.55-39.3 ) ; FELV 15 % ( 95 % CI : 3.2-37.9 ) , P=0.72 .
 There was significantly increased grade 3/4 neutropenia with FELV vs ECF ( 53.8 vs 29.5 % , respectively , P=0.020 ) .
 Symptom resolution was impressive for both regimens .
 This is the largest reported randomised study to date in this setting .
 ECF did not improve OS compared to FELV , but was associated with less acute toxicity .
 These data suggest that chemotherapy can prolong OS and achieve good symptomatic relief in advanced biliary cancer .
