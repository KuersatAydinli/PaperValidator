 CA19-9 as a prognostic factor in inoperable pancreatic cancer : the implication for clinical trials .
 In a multivariate analysis of 154 patients receiving chemotherapy , baseline CA19-9 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( OS ) ( HR 1.8 ; 95 % CI : 1.3-2.5 , P = 0.0004 ) .
 The 1-year OS was 19 and 46 % , respectively , for patients with a baseline CA19-9 above or below the median value .
 A fall of 20 % in CA19-9 level from baseline was an independent prognostic factor for OS ( HR 1.9 ; 95 % CI : 1.1-3.4 , P = 0.019 ) .
