 Evaluation of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer : a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial .
 Shark cartilage has been a popular complementary or alternative medicine intervention .
 The basis for this popularity is the claim that sharks rarely get cancer because of the high proportion of cartilage in the shark 's body .
 However , early studies were equivocal .
 Therefore , a clinical trial was conducted to look at the impact of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer .
 The primary goal of this trial was to determine whether a shark cartilage product improved overall survival for patients with advanced cancer who were getting standard care .
 Secondary research goals were to evaluate toxicities , tolerability , and quality of life associated with this shark cartilage product .
 The study was a two-arm , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , clinical trial .
 Patients with incurable breast or colorectal carcinoma had to have good performance status and organ function .
 Patients could be receiving chemotherapy .
 Patients were all to receive standard care and then to be randomly selected to receive either a shark cartilage product or an identical-appearing and smelling placebo 3 to 4 times each day .
 Data on a total of 83 evaluable patients were analyzed .
 There was no difference in overall survival between patients receiving standard care plus a shark cartilage product versus standard care plus placebo .
 Likewise , there was no suggestion of improvement in quality of life for patients receiving the shark cartilage , compared with those receiving placebo .
 This trial was unable to demonstrate any suggestion of efficacy for this shark cartilage product in patients with advanced cancer .
