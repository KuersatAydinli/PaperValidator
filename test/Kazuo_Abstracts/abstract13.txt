 Erlotinib in lung cancer - molecular and clinical predictors of outcome .
 A clinical trial that compared erlotinib with a placebo for non-small-cell lung cancer demonstrated a survival benefit for erlotinib .
 We used tumor-biopsy samples from participants in this trial to investigate whether responsiveness to erlotinib and its impact on survival were associated with expression by the tumor of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and EGFR gene amplification and mutations .
 EGFR expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in non-small-cell lung cancer specimens from 325 of 731 patients in the trial ; 197 samples were analyzed for EGFR mutations ; and 221 samples were analyzed for the number of EGFR genes .
 In univariate analyses , survival was longer in the erlotinib group than in the placebo group when EGFR was expressed ( hazard ratio for death , 0.68 ; P=0.02 ) or there was a high number of copies of EGFR ( hazard ratio , 0.44 ; P=0.008 ) .
 In multivariate analyses , adenocarcinoma ( P=0.01 ) , never having smoked ( P<0.001 ) , and expression of EGFR ( P=0.03 ) were associated with an objective response .
 In multivariate analysis , survival after treatment with erlotinib was not influenced by the status of EGFR expression , the number of EGFR copies , or EGFR mutation .
 Among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who receive erlotinib , the presence of an EGFR mutation may increase responsiveness to the agent , but it is not indicative of a survival benefit .
