 Paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel plus alternating carboplatin and cisplatin for initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer : long-term efficacy results : a Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group ( HeCOG ) study .
 We compared the combination plus Carboplatin plus paclitaxel , which is considered the treatment of choice for initial chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer ( AOC ) with a regimen combining alternating carboplatin and cisplatin plus paclitaxel .
 The two platinum derivatives have been previously combined as they are not totally cross-resistant and as they share no overlapping toxicities .
 Patients with AOC , after the initial cytoreductive surgery were randomized to either 6 courses of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 as 3 h infusion plus Carboplatin at 7 AUC ( Arm A ) or Paclitaxel at the same dose plus Carboplatin again at 7 AUC for cycles 1,3,5 , while for cycles 2,4,6 Cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 substituted for Carboplatin ( Arm B ) .
 247 patients are analyzed .
 Significant differences were not found , both in terms of PFS ( 38 vs 39 months , p=0.95 ) and overall survival ( 40.6 vs 38.6 months , p=0.79 ) .
 There was not also difference in 5-year survival rate ( 35 % vs 39 % ) or 5-year PFS rate ( 23 % vs 28 % ) .
 Age >60 , PS 2 , stage IV disease and presence of residual disease were adversely related to the overall survival .
 Both regimens are well tolerated and effective .
 Alternating cisplatin with carboplatin does not improve the results compared with the standard combination .
