Total Number
Male / Men
Female / Women
Whole group
N
total
Sex;Gender - women/men or female/male
[Gg]roup X

Heuristics:
- Try to get Male/Female count
- Exclude cells from p-value column: p[-][Vv]alue;P[-][Vv]alue
- Exclude cells from columns indicating "mean" value of the variables // containing "Â±"->should exclude many cells
- Exclude cells from columns indicating "ratio"
- Look for sample size in same sentence as Table Header - e.g Table 2 ...... X [Pp]atients;X [Pp]articipants; [Nn]=x
    Table 2....characteristics of X ...
- From the table collect all [Nn]=X. Check wheter their sum is equlivalent to one of the matches of the KC. Check whether
    the collection has a count which is the sum of other counts
- If rowIdentifier has "percent" -> than extrapolate corresponding number according to percentage value and
    check if KC has this number X +- 1
- If a column has Male/Female, then sample size likely be a rowIdentifier
- If a rowIdentifier has Male/Female, then sample size likely be a columnIdentifier

Tasks to do:
- For each <TableCell> implement following methods:
    String getContentAbove()
    String getContentLeft()
    String getContentRight()
    String getContentBelow()
    String getRowIdentifier() // first cell of corresponding row
    String getColumnIdentifier() // first cell of corresponding column
